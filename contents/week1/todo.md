<Panel header="Have a look at the 'module handbook'" expandable>

Apart from this Schedule page, there are two other important sources of information.
* The 'module handout' (available from IVLE files) is a self-contained set of materials that has been compiled as an e-book. The purpose of the handout is to serve as a reference to the materials covered during the lectures. As the handout is meant to be used in any introductory software engineering course, it does not contain course-related details such as assignment deliverables.
* The 'module handbook' specifies the course requirements of CS2103/T and is very comprehensive. There is no need to read everything; we will point you to the correct sections in due time.    
  Handbook sections to read around this time:
  General: Preliminaries | Text Books | Programming Language | Module Principles
  Project: The Product | Project Scope | Project Constraints |
  FAQ: Why the workload is so high? | Why so much bean counting? | Why you force me to visit a separate website instead of using IVLE?
