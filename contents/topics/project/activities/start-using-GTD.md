If you don't use a scheduling/task tracking tool (also known as <tooltip content="Getting things done">[GTD]()</tooltip> tools) to manage your schedules/tasks, start using one. There are many available (e.g. Google Calendar + Google Tasks, Todo.txt, Fantastical, Wunderlist, Any.do, Remember The Milk, etc. [here's](http://www.priacta.com/Articles/Comparison_of_GTD_Software.php) a long list). Not only it will help to keep track of your work, but also it will help you better understand the product domain of the module project. If you feel sceptical about this, check out rule #1 in [this](http://www.daniel-wong.com/2015/01/14/straight-a-student/) article.

To encourage you to do the above, we resist sending you reminders about module deadlines etc. You are expected to keep track of the them yourself.
