==IMPORTANT: Our tutorials start on week 2 (even before CORS tutorial bidding is over), not in week 3 as other modules do. CS2103 (not CS2103T) students need to choose a temporary tutorial slot for week 2 tutorial. We'll inform you the procedure to do so in due course.==

The structure of our tutorials is different from traditional tutorials.

* **50% assessment/feedback**: Up to 50% of our tutorial time is to be spent on interacting with your tutor as directed by the tutor. The purpose of this interaction is for the tutor to assess learning activities you claim to have done and give you feedback.
* **50% discussion**: The remaining 50% of the tutorial time is to be spent on discussing module activities with team members and helping each other w.r.t. those activities.

**The role of our tutors** is different from tutors in other modules.

* **No direct tech help**: Tutors are prohibited from giving technical help, because we want you to learn the vital survival skill of troubleshooting technical problems.    
  %%[cf Appendix D: How to get tech help]%%
* **No ‘teaching’**: Tutors are prohibited from “teaching” concepts that are covered in lectures or handouts. Self-learning is a vital part of the module. But tutors may help you clarify doubts. For example consider these two questions you might want to ask a tutor:
  * *This is how I understood/applied dependency injection. Is that correct?* - Such questions are welcome.    
    **Reason**:This question shows you have put in some effort to learn the topic and seeking further clarification from the tutor. 
  * *What is dependency injection?* - Such questions are not welcome.    
  **Reason**: This question implies you haven’t done what you could to learn the topic in concern. 

**No leading from the front**: Tutors are not expected to lead your project effort. They will not tell you how to do project tasks or when to do project tasks. You have to figure those out yourselves. But tutors will give you feedback on how you are doing (or have done) project tasks so that you can improve further.

**Timing/venue:**

* Please refer to the Schedule page for further details on each tutorial.
* You are expected to arrive on time.
  * If your tutorial is in **COM1-B103**: If you arrive early, you may enter the tutorial room by the door near the staircase and wait in the empty area of the room until the current class vacates the room.
  * If your tutorial is in **SR5**: If you arrive early, please wait outside the room until you are asked to come in.
* You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another class right after. There is no need to wait till the tutor dismisses you. However, inform the tutor before leaving if you leave before the class is dismissed.
* Please make sure you ==vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour== so that the next group can start on time. You may move to the empty area at the back of the room and continue your discussions after the class is over.
* In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration because 1 hour is barely enough to get through all the tutorial tasks. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and tutors. What you can do is to extend the tutorial time by yourselves. e.g. Meet 30 minutes before the tutorial starts and prepare yourselves for the tutorial task. Similarly, you can move your discussion to somewhere else after the tutorial is over and continue for some more time.

**Learning activities:**

Each tutorial has a list of learning activities. They are categorized as,

* **BASIC** (:star:) : Cover skills you should have if you want to PASS the module.
* **INTERMEDIATE** (:star::star:) : Cover skills you should have if you are aiming for a GOOD grade from this module, and a good career as a software engineer.
* **ADVANCED** (:star::star::star:) : Cover skills beyond the module syllabus. These are for students who want to go the extra mile to strengthen their skills.

**Grading:**

The following aspects of your conduct in tutorials will be considered when awarding participation marks. Grading is based on peer evaluations and tutor observations. Cf handbook section: Participation marks
* **Punctuality**: Arrived on time. Stayed in the tutorial at least 40 minutes.   
    %%Cf FAQ: [Why do I have to attend tutorials on time?]()%%
* **Attention**: Paid undivided attention to tutorial proceedings (i.e. no multi tasking). Took part in tutorial activities.   
    Note: When the tutor is discussing something with one team member (e.g., one team member is explaining how he/she used assertions), **the whole team is expected to pay attention** to that discussion, not do your own things. Whatever discussed is relevant to all of you, not just that team member.
* **Effort**: The amount of learning activities done before and during the tutorial.

**Other expectations:**

* **Please bring your laptop to tutorials.** You often need it to show your learning activity results. At other times, we ask you to work on project related things with your team members, which too may require the laptop. %%Cf FAQ: [What if I don't carry a laptop around?]()%%
