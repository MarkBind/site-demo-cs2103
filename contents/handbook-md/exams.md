No midterm.  
Final exam:

*   2 hours, open book, essay type questions (no MCQ), covers materials from all lectures, handouts, and tutorials.
*   Sample exam papers that are closest to this semester's format (and examiner's comments) can be found [here](../files/exampapers/).
*   Attend the last two lecture to learn more about the exam paper.
*   Exam consultations (consultations near the exam) are discouraged but allowed. We prefer you to learn and clarify along the way, not at the end.
*   Study tips:
    *   Go through the worked examples in handouts.
    *   Try past exam papers. Try to answer the questions before looking at answers given.
    *   Learn all parts of the project, not just the part you did.
    *   Explore how your project can be extended to support more features.  

Note that CS2103 paper measures how well you can apply the theory to a project. Therefore, the exam is strongly connected to the project and how you Â applied theory in the project. The exam will be easy for you if you attend lectures, participate in tutorials(tutorials too are focused on application of theory to the project), and do a sincere job in the project. ==You will not be able to ace the exams by simply doing past papers just before the exams.==
