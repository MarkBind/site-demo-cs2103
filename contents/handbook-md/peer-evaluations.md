We use the [TEAMMATES](http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/) online peer evaluation system to conduct several rounds of peer-evaluations.
All peer evaluations will be taken into account when determining your participation marks. The system also allows you to give anonymous feedback to your teammates.

**Extra Requirements:** [considered for participation marks]

  *   Submitting peer evaluations is compulsory. ==If you routinely miss submitting peer evaluations, you forfeit your participation marks.==
  *   TEAMMATES normally allows students to access it without using Google login. In this module, we ==require you to login to TEAMMATES using your Google account==. and update your
  *   After you login to TEAMMATES, please complete the profile . CS2103 is a big class. This profile helps us to remember you better, even after the module is over.
  *   In the profile, you are encouraged (but not compulsory) to provide your long term contact email (not school email) as the contact email. This contact email is for keeping in touch after graduation.

  *   Please upload a suitable profile photo.

  <Panel header="Choosing a profile photo" class="book" expandable>

The purpose of the profile photo is for the teaching team to identify you. Therefore, you should choose a recent individual photo showing your face clearly. Some examples can be seen in the 'Teaching team' page. Given below are some examples of good and bad profile photos.

<span id="giving-peer-feedback">

Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. ==Those who give ineffective feedback will be penalized.==

  Here are some things to keep in mind:

  *   Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.
  *   The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. `Thanks for all the hard work!` and negative ratings (e.g. `Equal share - 40%`) to the same team member is not being honest.
  *   State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.

The final peer evaluation will be used to determine the level of contribution from each member to the project. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked to ==estimate the contribution of each team member== (including yourself) to the project so far.

==Final peer evaluation affects your grade==in the following way:

*   If there is a general consensus about how much each one contributed, we award grades based on the contribution levels submitted through the peer evaluation. i.e., if everyone agrees you did more than others, you get more marks.
*   If there are significant discrepancies in the peer evaluations (e.g., you say you did an [equal share + 20%] while your team says you did an [equal share - 10%]), we will investigate further before finalizing project marks. For such teams, we are likely to request some or all members to ==submit an additional individual report== to itemize and quantify the contribution to the project. ==Overclaimers will be penalized.== Please do not claim high just to ‘see how’.

Peer evaluations are ==not visible to undergraduate tutors.==

==If you disagree with the team’s opinion==, i.e., you think the perceived contribution is significantly different from what you actually contributed, you can help us grade you fairly by submitting an individual report (‘individual report’ is explained under V0.5 deliverables).

Keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are based on team member perceptions and may not reflect your real contribution. ==We use those numbers primarily to identify cases that need further investigation.==

You may ==ignore minor variations== in the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES. For example, the difference between [Equal share] and [Equal share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due to rounding off within the system.

Also keep in mind that it is human nature for one to downplay the value of contributions from others when one’s own contribution is being compared to that of others. As a result, it is common for the ‘perceived contribution’ to be somewhat lower than what you actually did.

If you are unhappy about the peer-feedback received and would like to make your views known to the team, please allow at least one day to lapse before you fire off a response email. You are likely to respond more rationally when you had some time to think it over. Also keep in mind that we do take note of how well you handle such a situation. You need to act professionally when facing conflicting views, opposition, and even deliberate sabotage.

A final note on this issue :

==Please be sincere about how much you can do from the beginning==, rather than let your team members figure it out over the long run. Tell them how much you can do and what kind of work you are willing to do. If you are not open about it, they will still figure it out at the end; they will still report it (via the peer-evaluations), and your score will be adjusted all the same. Being open about it on the other hand can save everyone a lot of frustrations, unpleasantness, and bitterness.</td>
