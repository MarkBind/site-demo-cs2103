**Timing/venue**: Fri 1400-1600 ICube Auditorium. Lectures start at 1400 sharp and end around 1545 (15 minutes to travel to next lecture).

**Attendance**: Attendance for the ==first lecture is compulsory==.

**Webcast**: All lectures will be webcast. However, some things are not captured well in the webcast recording. You are advised to treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed during the lecture.

**Handouts**: Each lecture consists of 3-5 sections, supported by separate handouts. Links to handouts for a lecture will be ==added to the Schedule page on Wednesday== of that week. You are welcome to, but not required to, read through them before attending the lecture.

==**Read before tutorials**==: You are required to read the relevant handouts and ponder how to apply those concepts in your project before attending the corresponding tutorial. If you have any followup questions about handouts, please post in IVLE forums or ask during tutorials (if there is spare time).

**Post-lecture quizzes**: Each lecture will be followed by an IVLE quiz that can earn you participation points. 
Purpose: for you to self-test how well you understood the handouts and other “required” readings (if any). 
You can keep taking the quiz until you get full marks. We count the best effort only. 
IVLE quizzes open on Friday right after the lecture and closes on the following Tuesday 2359. 
Post-lecture quizzes are ==counted for [participation marks](#participation)==.

**Slides**: Because we are giving separate handouts, lecture slides do not contain content that you can print and use as a reference during the lecture or the exams. Instead, handouts serve as the main exam reference while slides will play only a supporting role during lecture delivery. Slides will be uploaded *after* the lecture.
