**Where is everything?** CS2103/T-related information are mainly in one of these two places:

* The **[Schedule page](index.html)** (organized chronologically): That is the one page you need to refer weekly.
* **Module handbook** (i.e. this page. organized by topic) This is a reference document supplementary to the schedule page. This page contains a lot of text, probably too much to read in one sitting. Instead, ==skim through it quickly to learn what it contains.== You can come back to read details as-and-when the need arises. The schedule page lists relevant sections of the Handbook you should read at various points.

**No reminder emails**: We try to minimize sending module details via announcements. The reason will be explained in lecture 1.

**CS2103 Vs CS2103T**: Same lectures, same exam. Separate tutorials, separate project grading. Unless specified otherwise, whatever is stated for one module applies to the other.

**What did seniors say about this module?** CS2103/T is **practical** and **useful** module, but also a **heavy** and **intensive** module, as you can see from [student feedback for a recent offering of the module]().
