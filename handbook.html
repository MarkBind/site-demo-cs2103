  <h1>Preliminaries</h1>
  <div id="handbook-preliminaries">
    <div>
      <p><strong>Where is everything?</strong> CS2103/T-related information are
        mainly in one of these two places:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong><a href="index.html">Schedule page</a></strong> (organized chronologically):
          That is the one page you need to refer weekly.</li>
        <li><strong>Module handbook</strong> (i.e. this page. organized by topic) This
          is a reference document supplementary to the schedule page. This page contains
          a lot of text, probably too much to read in one sitting. Instead,
          <mark>skim through it quickly to learn what it contains.</mark>You can come
          back to read details as-and-when the need arises. The schedule page lists
          relevant sections of the Handbook you should read at various points.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>No reminder emails</strong>: We try to minimize sending module
        details via announcements. The reason will be explained in lecture 1.</p>
      <p><strong>CS2103 Vs CS2103T</strong>: Same lectures, same exam. Separate
        tutorials, separate project grading. Unless specified otherwise, whatever
        is stated for one module applies to the other.</p>
      <p><strong>What did seniors say about this module?</strong> CS2103/T is <strong>practical</strong> and <strong>useful</strong> module,
        but also a <strong>heavy</strong> and <strong>intensive</strong> module, as
        you can see from <a href="">student feedback for a recent offering of the module</a>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h1>Lectures</h1>
  <div id="handbook-lectures">
    <div>
      <img src="images/Lecture photo.png" style="width: 713px;">
      <p><strong>Timing/venue</strong>: Fri 1400-1600 ICube Auditorium. Lectures
        start at 1400 sharp and end around 1545 (15 minutes to travel to next lecture).</p>
      <p><strong>Attendance</strong>: Attendance for the
        <mark>first lecture is compulsory</mark>.</p>
      <p><strong>Webcast</strong>: All lectures will be webcast. However, some
        things are not captured well in the webcast recording. You are advised
        to treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed
        during the lecture.</p>
      <p><strong>Handouts</strong>: Each lecture consists of 3-5 sections, supported
        by separate handouts. Links to handouts for a lecture will be
        <mark>added to the Schedule page on Wednesday</mark>of that week. You are welcome
        to, but not required to, read through them before attending the lecture.</p>
      <p>
        <mark><strong>Read before tutorials</strong>
        </mark>: You are required to read the relevant handouts and ponder how to apply
        those concepts in your project before attending the corresponding tutorial.
        If you have any followup questions about handouts, please post in IVLE
        forums or ask during tutorials (if there is spare time).</p>
      <p><strong>Post-lecture quizzes</strong>: Each lecture will be followed by
        an IVLE quiz that can earn you participation points. Purpose: for you to
        self-test how well you understood the handouts and other “required” readings
        (if any). You can keep taking the quiz until you get full marks. We count
        the best effort only. IVLE quizzes open on Friday right after the lecture
        and closes on the following Tuesday 2359. Post-lecture quizzes are
        <mark>counted for <a href="#participation">participation marks</a>
        </mark>.</p>
      <p><strong>Slides</strong>: Because we are giving separate handouts, lecture
        slides do not contain content that you can print and use as a reference
        during the lecture or the exams. Instead, handouts serve as the main exam
        reference while slides will play only a supporting role during lecture
        delivery. Slides will be uploaded <em>after</em> the lecture.</p>
      <p></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h1>Tutorials</h1>
  <div id="handbook-tutorials">
    <div>
      <p>
        <mark>IMPORTANT: Our tutorials start on week 2 (even before CORS tutorial bidding
          is over), not in week 3 as other modules do. CS2103 (not CS2103T) students
          need to choose a temporary tutorial slot for week 2 tutorial. We'll inform
          you the procedure to do so in due course.</mark>
      </p>
      <p>The structure of our tutorials is different from traditional tutorials.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>50% assessment/feedback</strong>: Up to 50% of our tutorial time
          is to be spent on interacting with your tutor as directed by the tutor.
          The purpose of this interaction is for the tutor to assess learning activities
          you claim to have done and give you feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>50% discussion</strong>: The remaining 50% of the tutorial time
          is to be spent on discussing module activities with team members and helping
          each other w.r.t. those activities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The role of our tutors</strong> is different from tutors in other
        modules.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No direct tech help</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from giving
          technical help, because we want you to learn the vital survival skill of
          troubleshooting technical problems.
          <br><span class="dimmed">[cf Appendix D: How to get tech help]</span>
        </li>
        <li><strong>No ‘teaching’</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from “teaching”
          concepts that are covered in lectures or handouts. Self-learning is a vital
          part of the module. But tutors may help you clarify doubts. For example
          consider these two questions you might want to ask a tutor:
          <ul>
            <li><em>This is how I understood/applied dependency injection. Is that correct?</em> -
              Such questions are welcome.
              <br><strong>Reason</strong>:This question shows you have put in some effort
              to learn the topic and seeking further clarification from the tutor.</li>
            <li><em>What is dependency injection?</em> - Such questions are not welcome.
              <br><strong>Reason</strong>: This question implies you haven’t done what you
              could to learn the topic in concern.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>No leading from the front</strong>: Tutors are not expected to
        lead your project effort. They will not tell you how to do project tasks
        or when to do project tasks. You have to figure those out yourselves. But
        tutors will give you feedback on how you are doing (or have done) project
        tasks so that you can improve further.
        <br><span class="dimmed">[Cf external resource: <a href="">A practitioner article about receiving feedback</a>]</span>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Timing/venue:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Please refer to the Schedule page for further details on each tutorial.</li>
        <li>You are expected to arrive on time.
          <ul>
            <li>If your tutorial is in <strong>COM1-B103</strong>: If you arrive early,
              you may enter the tutorial room by the door near the staircase and wait
              in the empty area of the room until the current class vacates the room.</li>
            <li>If your tutorial is in <strong>SR5</strong>: If you arrive early, please
              wait outside the room until you are asked to come in.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another
          class right after. There is no need to wait till the tutor dismisses you.
          However, inform the tutor before leaving if you leave before the class
          is dismissed.</li>
        <li>Please make sure you
          <mark>vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour</mark>so that the next group
          can start on time. You may move to the empty area at the back of the room
          and continue your discussions after the class is over.</li>
        <li>In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration
          because 1 hour is barely enough to get through all the tutorial tasks.
          Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and
          tutors. What you can do is to extend the tutorial time by yourselves. e.g.
          Meet 30 minutes before the tutorial starts and prepare yourselves for the
          tutorial task. Similarly, you can move your discussion to somewhere else
          after the tutorial is over and continue for some more time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Learning activities:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Each tutorial has a list of learning activities. They are categorized
        as,</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>BASIC</strong> (⭐️) : Cover skills you should have if you want
          to PASS the module.</li>
        <li><strong>INTERMEDIATE</strong> (⭐️⭐️) : Cover skills you should have if
          you are aiming for a GOOD grade from this module, and a good career as
          a software engineer.</li>
        <li><strong>ADVANCED</strong> (⭐️⭐️⭐️) : Cover skills beyond the module syllabus.
          These are for students who want to go the extra mile to strengthen their
          skills.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Grading:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The following aspects of your conduct in tutorials will be considered
        when awarding participation marks. Grading is based on peer evaluations
        and tutor observations. Cf handbook section: Participation marks</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Punctuality</strong>: Arrived on time. Stayed in the tutorial
          at least 40 minutes.
          <br><span class="dimmed">Cf FAQ: <a href="">Why do I have to attend tutorials on time?</a></span>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Attention</strong>: Paid undivided attention to tutorial proceedings
          (i.e. no multi tasking). Took part in tutorial activities.
          <br>Note: When the tutor is discussing something with one team member (e.g.,
          one team member is explaining how he/she used assertions), <strong>the whole team is expected to pay attention</strong> to
          that discussion, not do your own things. Whatever discussed is relevant
          to all of you, not just that team member.</li>
        <li><strong>Effort</strong>: The amount of learning activities done before
          and during the tutorial.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Other expectations:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Please bring your laptop to tutorials.</strong> You often need
          it to show your learning activity results. At other times, we ask you to
          work on project related things with your team members, which too may require
          the laptop. <span class="dimmed">Cf FAQ: <a href="">What if I don't carry a laptop around?</a></span>

  <h1>Project</h1>
  <div id="handbook-project">
    <div>
      <p>CS2103 project is structured to resemble the initial stages of a non-trivial
        real-life software project. In this project you will conceptualize a product
        and build a scaled-down version of the product, and
        <mark>have it ready to be continued by someone else</mark>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>The product</h2>
  <div id="handbook-project-product">
    <div>
      <p>In this semester, we build a scaled-down version of ‘a Siri for keyboards’.
        i.e. a tool that can accept natural language commands via keyboard. This
        is for folks who can type fast, spend most of the time near a computer,
        and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands.</p>
      <p>It is ‘scaled down’ in the following ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>It handles only commands related to managing the user's schedule and todo
          tasks.</li>
        <li>The commands will not be truly ‘natural language’. The command format
          will be flexible, but still quite structured. NLP (Natural Language Processing)
          is not required.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Let us use the generic term 'Task Manager' to refer to this product. You
        should give it a different name yourself.</p>
      <p><strong>Problem outline</strong>: We are bombarded with ‘things to do’
        continuously. Some things need to be done during specific times (e.g.,
        attend meeting), some have deadlines (e.g., submit report), and others
        are simply ‘to be done someday’ (e.g., read ‘Lord of the Rings’). The pile
        of todo items accumulates and weighs heavily on our mind at times. Sometimes
        things go out of control and we forget to do certain things on time.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution outline</strong>: The software should help user to put
        these todo items into a systematic process that tracks them and helps the
        user to decide what to do and when to do things so that the user doesn’t
        have to remember the todo items.</p>
      <p><strong>Target audience</strong>: There are many similar software that
        tackles some aspect of this problem (todo lists software, calendar software,
        GTD software). Because it is a crowded product space, our strategy is to
        become a niche player by targeting a specific user group. Our target users
        are people like Jim whose workflow is described below.</p>
      <img src="images/Jim at his computer.png"
      style="width: 500px;">
      <p>Most of Jim’s todo items arrive as emails. This is how Jim processes his
        emails.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Decides what is the follow up action required by that email.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If it can be done immediately, he does it right away (e.g., just reply
              to the email) and ‘archive’ the email (i.e. move it out of inbox).</li>
            <li>If it cannot be done immediately, he schedules the follow up action in
              his calendar and archives the email. If he cannot decide a good time to
              do the action, he simply schedules it in a relatively free area in his
              calendar.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When Jim is free to do some work, he looks at his calendar and picks up
            something that he can do at that time. Once the task is done, he marks
            it as ‘done’. If there is a further follow up action required, he schedules
            it in the calendar.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Jim periodically reviews the calendar to pick items that could not be
            completed and need to be rescheduled or discarded as ‘cannot do’.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Todo items not arising from email are dealt similarly by entering them
            in the calendar.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>As you can see from the above workflow, Jim’s inbox is almost empty most
        of time (<span class="dimmed">cf <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero">Inbox Zero</a></span>).
        He no longer worries about an inbox full of emails he has to deal with
        at any time he login to email. He also does not have to keep any todo items
        in his mind because everything is recorded somewhere. However, here are
        some ‘pain points’ in his workflow.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jim is currently using Google calendar. Because he stores/retrieves/edits
          todo tasks so frequently, he finds the online calendar too slow to work
          with. He’d rather have a desktop software he can summon quickly. Even better
          (but not a must) if he can activate the software by pressing a keyboard
          shortcut. He is quite impressed by how the <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy tool can be activated easily by pressing Alt+Space</a>.</li>
        <li>A calendar is not very good in capturing tasks that need to be done before
          a specific date/time, or after a specific date/time, and items without
          specific times.</li>
        <li>Entering an event in a calendar is a pain because it takes several clicks.
          He prefers a ‘one shot’ approach. e.g., to be able to type in commands
          such as "<code>add July 10, 5-6, project meeting</code>" (such as allowed
          by <a href="http://gappstips.com/google-calendar/use-quick-add-to-speed-up-google-calendar-entries/">GCal’s ‘quick add’ feature</a>).</li>
        <li>While it is good that all Jim’s todo items are currently online and available
          to access from any computer, he always uses his own laptop or office PC
          to access them and sometimes from places where there is no ready Internet
          connectivity.</li>
        <li>Jim finds it a pain to do certain things important to his workflow but
          not so important in a regular calendar. e.g. looking for suitable slot
          to schedule an item, marking an item as done, deciding what todo item to
          do next, postponing an item.</li>
        <li>A calendar does not have an easy way to “block” multiple slots when the
          exact timing of a task is uncertain, and release the blocked slots when
          the time is finalized. e.g., Block Mon 2-3pm and Tue 2-3pm for a meeting
          with boss → the meeting is confirmed for Tue → automatically release Mon
          slot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Design your product to solve some of Jim’s problems to make his workflow
        even more efficient and painless. i.e. to make his life better. You don’t
        have to solve all problems mentioned above and there may be other problems
        you could solve but not mentioned above. Good software delights users by
        solving problems users don’t even realize they have.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong>
        <mark>Command Line Interface is the primary mode of input.</mark>The GUI is
        primarily for output. That is, the GUI is used to give visual feedback
        rather than to collect input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to
        click the minimize button), but the primary input should be command-driven.
        Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and typing is preferred
        over key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster
        by typing compared to mouse or key combinations.</p>

  </div>
  <h2>Project Scope</h2>
  <div id="handbook-project-scope">
    <div>
      <p>The scope of the project will be restricted. This is to reduce your workload
        and discourage an ‘arms race’ where you try to implement as many features
        as possible with no time to spend on learning good software engineering
        principles and practices.</p>
      <p>Write the software to cater to Jim. He is an office worker who has an
        office computer (used when at office) and his personal laptop (used when
        at home or travelling). His computers are not shared by other colleagues
        or family members. He is not expected to use this software for collaborative
        work scheduling with others.</p>
      <p>
        <mark>Narrowing/widening the scope of the project further is discouraged.</mark>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Must-have features:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Support for events (i.e., has a start time and end time), deadlines (tasks
          that have to be done before a specific deadline), and floating tasks (tasks
          without specific times). Note that these category names are temporary names
          only. You should figure out what are the best names for these categories.
          Are these names intuitive to end-users? Should they even care about consciously
          categorizing tasks?</li>
        <li>CRUD (i.e., Create, Read, Update, Delete) support for tasks.</li>
        <li>Undo operations (at least for the most recent action)</li>
        <li>Some flexibility in the command format: Support a few natural variations
          of the command format.</li>
        <li>Simple search: A simple text search for finding an item if the user remembers
          some keywords from the item description.</li>
        <li>Some way to keep track of which items are done and which are yet to be
          done.</li>
        <li>The ability to specify a specific folder and a file for data storage.
          With this feature, Jim can choose to store the data file in a local folder
          controlled by a cloud syncing service (e.g. dropbox), allowing him to access
          task data from multiple computers.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Nice to have features :</strong> (you may implement 0 or more of
        these features)</p>
      <p>Difficulty-low</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AutomatedTesting : Achieve a very high level of automated testing.</li>
        <li>RecurringTasks: Support for managing recurring tasks. e.g. CS2103 lectures
          are a recurring task from week 1 to week 13 except in recess week.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Difficulty-medium</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PowerSearch : More powerful and intelligent search. e.g. search for empty
          slots, near-match search, auto-complete (similar to Google search box),
          filters for other attributes (e.g. start time).</li>
        <li>FlexiCommands: High flexibility in command format. e.g., non-strict ordering
          of keywords, ability to specify aliases for commands, support for more
          ‘natural’ language input, multiple undo/redo, How flexible should the format
          be? As flexible, intuitive, and user-friendly as you can make it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Difficulty-high</p>
      <ul>
        <li>GoodGui: A good GUI to give visual feedback to the user e.g., in-built
          guidance for new users, good visual feedback for actions, feedback while
          typing commands, hotkey to activate/hide, notifications, etc. conveying
          more information visually (e.g. more important/urgent tasks stand out from
          the rest, longer events look different from shorter events, easy to see
          free slots, etc.)</li>
        <li>GoogleIntegration: Google Calendar integration. e.g. upload todo items
          to GCal, two-way sync, Support for GCal quick add command format, etc.
          You may also use the Google Tasks API for this.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also propose your own extra features(subject to approval). Note
        that
        <mark>each student must implement at least one feature individually (in addition
          to features implemented collectively with other team members) and the average
          amount of code one member is expected to write for the project is 0.5-1.5
          KLoC.</mark>Reason: Each student must learn all parts of the code and write
        a significant amount of code.</p>
      <p>Adding more features may not necessarily increase your score as
        <mark>half-baked features, ill-fitting features, and buggy features will bring
          your score down</mark>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Project Constraints</h2>
  <div id="handbook-project-constraints">
    <div>
      <p>You should also comply with the following constraints. The purpose of
        these constraints is to increase comparability among submissions and to
        maximize applicability of module content in the project.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-Morph</strong>: The final product should be a result
            of morphing the given sample code. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given
            code to arrive at the new software.
            <br>Reason: To ensure your code has a decent quality level from the start.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-Desktop</strong>: The software should be a desktop
            app (i.e. not a Mobile or a Web app). Reason: Desktop apps are more general
            than other platforms such as mobile/embedded/web and therefore, provides
            a good starting point before you move to those platforms.
            <br>You are allowed to integrate with online services such as Google Calendar
            as long as the app can provide a reasonable level of functionality even
            when offline.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-CLI</strong>: Command Line Interface is the primary
            mode of input. If you implement a GUI, it should be primarily for output.
            That is, the GUI is used to give visual feedback rather than to collect
            input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button),
            but the primary input should be command-driven. Mouse actions should have
            keyboard alternatives and typing is preferred over key combinations. Design
            the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse
            or key combinations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-Standalone</strong>: The software should work stand-alone.
            It should not be a plug-in to another software. However, you can build
            optional extensions that integrate your application with other existing
            software. Furthermore, you are allowed to build extensions that can plug
            into your software.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-No-Database</strong>: The software should not use relational
            databases. Data storage must be done using text files you create yourself.
            <br>Reason: Using relational databases reduces the scope for applying Object-oriented
            techniques.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-Human-Editable-File</strong>: The data should be stored
            locally and should be in a human editable text file. The intention of this
            constraint is to allow advanced users to manipulate the data by editing
            the data file.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-OO</strong>: The software should follow the Object-oriented
            paradigm.
            <br>Reason: For you to practice OOP that you learned in the course.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-Windows</strong>: The software should work on the Windows
            7 or later.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-No-Installer</strong>: The software should work without
            requiring an installer. Having an optional installer is OK as longs as
            the portable (non-installed) version has all the critical functionality.
            <br>Reason: We do not want to install all your projects on our testing machines
            when we test them for grading.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Constraint-External-Software</strong>: The use of third-party
            frameworks/libraries is allowed but only if they,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>are free.</li>
            <li>do not require any installation by the user of your software.</li>
            <li>do not violate other constraints.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>and subject to prior approval by us. We will not allow third-party software
            that can interfere with the learning objectives of the module. Please post
            your request for approval in IVLE forum before you start using the library.
            Reason: The whole class should know which external software are used by
            others so that they can do the same if they wish to.</p>

      <p>To expedite your project implementation, you will be given some sample
        code (AddressBook-Level1 to AddressBook-Level4, shown as <code>AB-1</code> to <code>AB-4</code> in
        the diagram above) that you can use as the basis for improving your individual
        skills during Phases A and as the basis for your project in Phase B.</p>
      <p>The sub-sections further down explain each project deliverable in detail.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>V0.0 : The Concept</h2>
  <div id="handbook-project-v00">
    <div>
      <p>The objective of this deliverable is for you to analyze requirements,
        conceptualize the product, and document it.</p>
      <h3>Step 1 : Brainstorm user stories</h3>
      <img src="images/v00.png" width="250px">
      <p>Get together with your team members and brainstorm user stories for the
        product.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>e.g.
          <br><code>As a user I can add a task by specifying a task description only, so that I can record tasks that need to be done ‘some day’.</code>
          <br><code>As a user I can find upcoming tasks, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.</code>
          <br><code>As a user I can delete a task, so that I can get rid of tasks that I no longer care to track.</code>
          <br><code>As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to use various commands.</code>
          <br><code>As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.</code>
          <br>Note how the story covers who (the user), what (the functionality) and
          why (the value) aspects.</li>
        <li>It is ok to have more user stories than you can deliver in the project.You
          should have at least 30 user stories. Include all 'obvious' ones you can
          think of but also look for 'non obvious' ones that you think are likely
          to be missed by other teams.</li>
        <li>Write each use story in a piece of paper (e.g. yellow sticky note, index
          card, or just pieces of paper about the size of a playing card). Alternatively
          you can use an online tool such as Trello for recording the initial collection
          of user stories.</li>
        <li>Note that
          <mark>you should not 'evaluate' the value of user stories while doing the above</mark>.
          An important aspect of brainstorming is not judging the ideas generated.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Step 2: Prioritize the user stories</h3>
      <img src="images/userstories.png" width="250px">
      <p>Suggested workflow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Take one use story at a time and get team member opinions about it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto
            one of these three piles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Must-Have</code> : The product will be practically useless to Jim
              without this feature.</li>
            <li><code>Nice-To-Have</code> : Jim can benefit from this user story significantly
              but you are not certain if you'll have time to implement it.</li>
            <li><code>Not-Useful</code> : No significant benefit to Jim.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After all stories have been put in the above three piles, you can make
            a record of which stories are in the three piles.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are some tips to improve the effectiveness of the above activity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Define Jim:</strong>
          <br>Decide our target user Jim's work patterns. e.g. Does he work in groups
          or alone? Does he share his computer with others? (answer: no). Having
          a clear picture of Jim's work patterns will help when deciding the importance
          of a user story.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't be biased by the implementation plans:</strong>
          <br>This exercise is for identifying user needs. Clear your mind of ideas
          you have about what your product will look like. Assume that you do not
          know yet what product you will build.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong>
          <br>At this point, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough
          for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later.
          If a user story in the Nice-To-Have pile turn out to be too difficult to
          implement later, you can always not implement it.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong>
          <br>Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least
          for some potential users.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't go into too much details when sorting user stories:</strong>
          <br>For example, consider this user story:
          <ul>
            <li>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most
              at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.*
              <br>When discussing this user story, you do not need to worry about what tasks
              should be considered 'needs my attention most at the present time'. Those
              details can be worked out later.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Step 3: Survey existing products</h3>
      <p>See how well existing products meet Jim's needs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Select a few competing products to study. Each person should study at
            least one existing product. Identify strengths and weaknesses of the product
            w.r.t. how well it can cater for Jim’s requirements.</p>
          <p>Here are some popular 'task manager' type products out there you can consider
            exploring (you are not limited to these): Google Calendar + Google Tasks
            | <a href="https://hitask.com">HiTask</a> | <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> |
            <a
            href="http://todotxt.com/">Todo.txt</a>| <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> | <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> |
              Microsoft Outlook | <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Note</strong>: Don’t get discouraged if an existing product meets
            Jim’s needs quite well. We are trying to learn SE, not sell a product.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After looking at existing products, you may want to go back and revise
            some of the user stories.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Step 4: Conceptualize the product as a user guide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Based on your user story categorization in step 1 and given project requirements
          (note that the project requirements specify some must-have features), select
          which user stories you are likely to include in V0.5.</li>
        <li>Based on the user stories you selected above, specify the product you
          are going to build, in the form of a user guide. Yes, strangely enough,
          in this project we draft the user guide before we build the product. This
          will help you/us visualize the final product before you start implementing
          it.</li>
        <li>
          <mark>Remember to take into account the UI design and the functionalities available
            in AddressBook Level 4</mark>. As you will be using that software as the
          starting point of your implementation, it makes sense to align your product
          with it (within reason) to minimize the implementation effort.</li>
        <li>Remember to include the exact command format because it is the core part
          of your UI.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use the documentation in the sample project as an example. Given below
        are pages to update.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>User guide</strong>:
            <br>Describe what the product would be like when it is submitted at the end
            of the semester. Starting from the time user starts using the product for
            the first time, describe how the user uses the product to accomplish various
            tasks.
            <br>Here are some ‘quick start guides’ you can look at for inspiration when
            writing your user guide:
            <br><a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate/blob/master/docs/User-Guide.md">Collate project</a>,
            <a
            href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT202033">iPhone :How to get started</a>, <a href="https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/instructorHelp.jsp#gs">TEAMMATES (for instructors)</a>
              <br>Use UI prototypes/sketches if necessary. They can be simple sketches drawn
              on whiteboard/paper and scanned/photographed or created using a tool such
              as PowerPoint, HTML, or <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balasmiq</a>.
              <br>State what you honestly believe you can do, based on information you have
              at this point. You will not be penalized if you cannot deliver what you
              proposed to deliver. It is OK to tweak the project scope along the way.
              <br>
              <mark>Specify the command format in detail</mark>as it is an important part
              of the product functionality.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Developer guide</strong>: Update the following appendices.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>User Stories</strong>: Give a list of the user stories, including
              priorities. This can include user stories considered but will not be included
              in the final product.</li>
            <li><strong>Use cases</strong>: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative
              user stories that need multiple steps to complete. e.g.
              <ul>
                <li>Rescheduling a task, which may require two steps: locating the task first
                  and then updating it.</li>
                <li>Checking a day's schedule at the end of the day: requires filtering the
                  day's tasks, marking complete tasks as done, and rescheduling or deleting
                  remaining tasks.</li>
                <li>Finding something to do where here is a free time.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong>:
              <br>Note: User stories capture functional requirements. What are the non-functional
              requirements of your project? Many of the project constraints mentioned
              above are NFRs. You can add more. e.g. performance requirements, usability
              requirements, scalability requirements, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Glossary</strong>: Define terms that are worth defining.</li>
            <li><strong>Product survey</strong>: Describe a summary of the product survey.
              i.e. Pros, cons, (from Jim's point of view). Each student should document
              the product they explored. If multiple students have explored the same
              product, you may have to explore more products to complete this section.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Suggested length</strong>: Take the sample project as a baseline.</p>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Update the relevant sections of the relevant
        markdown documents (i.e. <code>UserGuide.md, DeveloperGuide.md</code>) in
        your repo. <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">git tag</a> as <code>V0.0</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Reaching this milestone (and future milestones)
        will be counted under 'Project management' component of the final project
        grade.
        <br>To claim this milestone as 'reached', you should at least have a full
        draft version of the above documents in some format (e.g. GoogleDoc), even
        if you didn't have time to update the markdown documents in the repo.</p>

  <h2>V0.1 : The Walking Skeleton</h2>
  <div id="handbook-project-v01">
    <div>
      <h3>V0.1 Product</h3>
      <p>This is the sample project morphed to be more like your target product.
        Functionality can be limited to only those that can be refactored from
        the sample project. e.g. support for adding and deleting floating tasks.</p>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Push the code to GitHub and <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">git tag</a> as <code>V0.1</code>.
        Refer to the Schedule page for further submission instructions.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: To consider this milestone as reached, you should
        have at least add/delete/find support for floating tasks. You should be
        able to do that by deleting/renaming the given Address Book code, without
        having to add too much new code.
        <br>The most important thing is not to break the code while morphing sample
        code to your target product.</p>

          <p><strong>About Us page</strong>:
            <br>This page is used for module admin purposes.
            <mark>Please follow the format closely to avoid penalties</mark>. For example,
            use a recent solo photo with your face clearly visible (similar to those
            in the 'Teaching Team' page).
            <br>The
            <mark>photo of a team member should be <code>doc/images/githbubid.png</code>
            </mark>e.g. <code>doc/images/damithc.png</code> where <code>githubid</code> is the
            team member's GitHub ID <strong>in lower case</strong>. Remove photos of
            the SE-EDU developers. No need to include a photo of the supervisor.</p>
          <p>Indicate the different roles played and responsibilities held by each
            team member. You can reassign these roles and responsibilities later in
            the project, if necessary.</p>
          <panel header="&lt;strong&gt;Roles and responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;"
          expandable="">Roles imply aspects you are in charge of and responsible for. E.g., if
            you are in charge of documentation, you are the person who should allocate
            who should write which part, ensure the document is in right format, ensure
            consistency etc. Here are some typical roles:
            <ul>
              <li><em>Team lead</em>: Responsible for overall project coordination.</li>
              <li>_Documentation_em> (short for ‘in charge of documentation’): Responsible
                for the quality of various project documents.</li>
              <li><em>Testing</em>: Ensures the testing of the project is done properly
                and on time.</li>
              <li><em>Code quality</em>: Looks after code quality, ensures adherence to
                coding standards, etc.</li>
              <li><em>Deliverables and deadlines</em>: Ensure project deliverables are done
                on time and in the right format.</li>
              <li><em>Integration</em>: In charge of versioning of the code, maintaining
                the code repository, integrating various parts of the software to create
                a whole.</li>
              <li><em>Scheduling and tracking</em>: In charge of defining, assigning, and
                tracking project tasks.</li>
              <li><em>[Tool ABC] expert</em>: e.g. Eclipse expert, Git expert, etc. Helps
                other team member with matters related to the specific tool.</li>
              <li><em>In charge of[Component XYZ]</em>: e.g. In charge of Model, GUI, Storage,
                etc. If you are in charge of a component, you are expected to know that
                component well, do the initial refactoring of the component (during V0.1
                and V0.2) and review changes done to that component in V0.3-V0.5.</li>
              <li>You may define additional roles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please make sure each of the above roles are assigned to one person in
              the team. It is OK to have a ‘backup’ for each role, but you should still
              have one person who is unequivocally the main person playing that role.</p>

          <p><strong><a href="http://README.md">README.md</a></strong> page: Update
            it to match your project. In particular, add a UI mockup of your intended
            final product.
            <br>Note that the
            <mark>image of the UI should be <code>doc/images/Ui.png</code>
            </mark>so that it can be downloaded by our scripts.
            <br>Also, remember to acknowledge the original source of the code i.e. The

  <h2>V0.2 : The MVP</h2>
  <div id="handbook-project-v02">
    <div>
      <h3>V0.2 Product</h3>
      <p>This is the first MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the product.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <mark>It should be a viable, possibly minimal product</mark>. This is not a
            walking skeleton. A user should be able to use it. It may not be user-friendly,
            but it should not be unusable. Try to include at least the basic CRUD facilities
            for at least one type of tasks. Here are some examples that are NOT acceptable:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>example 1. Has a well-developed functionality to add tasks but does not
            support commands for deleting or editing tasks: This is not usable because
            the user cannot rectify errors made while creating tasks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>example 2. Has all the CRUD functionality implemented but they are not
            connected to the UI: This too is not usable by the end-user.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>While this is an internal release (not a production release),
            <mark>you are expected to maintain a reasonable code quality at all times</mark>.
            In particular, you should comply with the coding standard all the time.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Push the code to GitHub and <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">git tag</a> as <code>V0.2</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: To pass this checkpoint, your product should
        have reached the MVP stage.</p>
      <h3>V0.2 Documentation</h3>
      <p>You are encouraged to update your project documentation to match the product
        but you are not required to submit them for evaluation. Note that this
        flexibility is given solely to reduce your workload. In a production environment,
        the documentation should always be kept in sync with the product.</p>
      <h3>V0.2 Demo</h3>
      <p>As before, show the demo to the tutor during the tutorial.
        <br>The demo should use the version tagged as <code>V0.2</code>, not the latest
        code. No tinkering with code during the tutorial.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>V0.3</h2>
  <div id="handbook-project-v03">
    <div>
      <h3>V0.3 Product</h3>
      <p>This version should be a more functional version than V0.2 and should
        contain at least a basic version of features you intend to release in the
        final version.</p>
      <p>Ideally, V0.3 should be good enough for <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dogfooding%20(to%20dogfood)">dog fooding</a>.
        Try to reach a dogfooding-ready version of the 'must have' features at
        least.</p>
      <p>From V0.3,
        <mark>you are required to divide work based on features</mark>rather than component.
        That is, each team member should implement 0 or more features end-to-end,
        doing required changes in <em>all</em> components. The objective of this
        switch is to force you to learn all components of the software, instead
        of limiting yourself to your own components.
        <br>Note that you will continue to be in charge of your own components although
        others will be modifying your components' code. Your new role is to help
        others modify code in your components (you are supposed to be the most
        knowledgeable about those components) and protect your components from
        degrading. For example, you can review others' changes to your components
        and suggest possible changes. This is also a good time to switch to a PR
        based workflow (if you haven't done that already) as PRs can be reviewed
        by other team members before merging.</p>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: V0.3 (and future milestones)
        <mark>should be released using GitHub's release mechanism</mark>. The release
        should include an executable JAR file. Refer the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1617S2/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#making-a-release">'Making a Release' section of the sample developer guide</a> for
        more info.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: To pass this checkpoint, your product should
        be noticeably better than an MVP. It goes without saying that other project
        management requirements expected at reaching a milestone (mentioned in
        the <a href="#using-milestones">'Using Milestones' section of Appendix E</a>)
        are applicable too.</p>
      <h3>V0.3 Documentation</h3>
      <p>Follow the documentation in the sample project in terms or organization,
        level of details, etc.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Guide</strong>: Update User Guide to match what you plan
          to deliver at V0.5</li>
        <li><strong>Developer Guide</strong>: Update Developer Guide to match your
          current design or the design you plan to have at V0.5.
          <br>[1] While it is OK for some sections to be written collectively,
          <mark>each student should have some sections that were written individually</mark>.
          For example, the section describing the design of Logic component should
          be written by the person in charge of the Logic component.
          <br>[2] It is
          <mark>not enough to simply do minor tweaks to the existing document</mark>to
          match your project if your design is very similar to the sample given.
          We need to see a significant amount of content written by each student
          to judge how well you can document technical details and use relevant models.
          <br>Here are some things you can add:
          <ul>
            <li>Compare the current design with other alternative designs possible.</li>
            <li>Add more descriptions e.g. show at least one interaction within each component.</li>
            <li>Use object diagrams to show sample object structures at runtime (if it
              helps the reader).</li>
            <li>Explain how you implemented complicated features such as undo/redo.</li>
            <li>In future (after these topics have been covered):
              <ul>
                <li>Use Activity Diagrams and OO Domain Models where applicable.</li>
                <li>Mention where design patterns/principles are applied.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Must be included in the version tagged <code>V0.3</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: To pass this checkpoint, your documentation
        should have been updated to match your project.</p>
      <h3>V0.3 Demo</h3>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Demo to the tutor during the tutorial. <strong>Use jar</strong> file
        for the demo, not the IDE.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Must use the version tagged <code>V0.3</code> and
        should be at least very close to a dog-fooding-ready state.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>V0.4</h2>
  <div id="handbook-project-v04">
    <div>
      <h3>V0.4 Product</h3>
      <p>Functionality expectations: This version should have decent implementations
        of all major features you intend to release, although some finer tweaks
        may be missing and not completely stable.</p>
      <p>
        <mark><strong>Dogfood your product</strong> and find ways to improve it.</mark>Remember
        to keep the dogfooding version of the app (i.e. the jar file) in a separate
        folder as evidence of dogfooding. i.e. Don't use the IDE for dogfooding
        (Dogfooding is an acceptance test; it should be done in the user environment)</p>
      <p><strong>Mark your code</strong> with special tag <code>@@author</code> so
        that we can extract code written by each of you using the collate tool
        (for evaluation purposes). After that, Use the collate tool to extract
        individual code and look through the generated <strong>.md</strong> files
        to ensure all your code has been extracted correctly.
        <mark>Push the *.md files created to a folder called /collated</mark>in your
        repo. More instructions below.</p>
      <p><strong>Extract your code for code quality grading</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author matric-number</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.
            The comment syntax may vary based on file type e.g. for markdown, fxml,
            html</p><pre><code>&lt;!-- @@author matric-number --&gt;
</code></pre>
          <p>Here is a sample code file:</p><pre><code>//@@author A0909865T
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author A0702345U
method 3 ...
//@@author A0909865X
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the
            code a person wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag
            or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was
            written by that author.
            <br>However, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no matric number)
            to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote, if you don't know who
            wrote the code segment below yours. The author of that code segment can
            add the matric number to the empty tag later.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If a method was written by more than one person, the <code>//@@author</code> tag
            should indicate the person who wrote most of that method. i.e., <code>//@@author</code> tag
            should not appear inside a method.
            <br>If some part of the code was done collectively, you should still divide
            it up to reflect the amount of work each person contributed. For example,
            if 3 people wrote 150 lines of code and put in equal effort in doing so,
            you can divide the methods among yourselves roughly 50 lines to each person.
            Once a code segment is allocated to one person, that person is responsible
            (and will be graded for) the quality of that code. If parts of that code
            was written by someone else and those parts are not of high quality, the
            designated author should refactor the code to make it high quality.
            <br>Tip: GitHub has a 'blame' feature and a 'history' feature that can help
            you determine who wrote a piece of code.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments as only
            the content below that tag will be collated.</p><pre><code>/**
  * Returns true if ...
  * @@author A0909865T
  */
</code></pre><pre><code>//@@author A0909865T
/**
  * Returns true if ...
  */
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final
            product,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code>
            </li>
            <li>Move unused files to that folder (those files should contain unused code
              only)</li>
            <li>use <code>//@@author matric-number</code> to mark unused code in those files.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>e.g.</p><pre><code>//@@author A0909865T-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
          <p>Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>//@@author</code> tag should be used to mark <em>all</em> code/test
            you claim credit for. There is no need to mark documentation files.
            <br>You will be penalized if you try to boost the length of your collated
            files using unethical means such as duplicating the same code in multiple
            places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant
            tests. Even repetitive code blocks within test methods should be extracted
            out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.
            <br>Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated
            files contain the correct content.
            <br>If you notice a team member claiming credit for code that he/she did not
            write, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>INCLUDE</strong>: everything that required significant ‘writing’
                effort. e.g. comments, test code, styling (e.g. css), xml, even test data
                files. But do not include chunks of text that were trivially copy pasted
                e.g. a test data file with 1000 tasks that was used to test performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Code you reused</strong> from elsewhere: Mark such code as <code>//@@author matric-number-reused</code>
              </p>
              <p>e.g.</p><pre><code>//@@author A0909865T-reused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>EXCLUDE</strong> code generated by the IDE/framework. You may also
                mark such code <code>//@@author generated</code>
              </p>
              <p>e.g.</p><pre><code>//@@author generated
method 1 ...
method 2 ...

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You need to put the,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>collated functional code in <code>collated/main</code> folder,</li>
            <li>collated test code in <code>collated/test</code> folder, and</li>
            <li>collated unused code in <code>collated/unused</code> folder</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Given below are DOS sample commands you can put in a batch file and run
            it to collate the code.</p><pre><code>java -jar Collate-TUI.jar collate from src/main to collated/main include java, fxml, css

      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Push the code (
        <mark>including the <code>collated</code> folder</mark>and files created above)
        to GitHub and tag as <code>V0.4</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: To pass this checkpoint, your product should
        satisfy the description given above and the code should be collated properly.</p>
      <h3>V0.4 Documentation</h3>
      <p>Recommended to update the documentation to match the product, at least
        w.r.t. major changes since previous version.
        <br>
        <mark>Update the <a href="http://AboutUs.md">AboutUs.md</a> page</mark>to reflect
        <a
        href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103/website/blob/master/contents/AboutUs.md">this sample</a>. Use the appropriate hyperlinks (as given in the sample)
          to substantiate your claimed contribution.
          <br>Note: <a href="http://AboutUs.md">AboutUs.md</a> page is used for module
          admin purposes. You are advised to follow the format closely to avoid penalties.
          E.g. those you don't have a suitable photo in that page will be penalized.</p>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Must be included in the version tagged <code>V0.4</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Not graded.</p>
      <h3>V0.4 Demo</h3>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: To be done during the tutorial, but note
        the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Duration: 10 minutes (max)</li>
        <li>It
          <mark>should be a 'well prepared' demo</mark>. You should know in advance exactly
          what you'll do in the demo.</li>
        <li>It should be a full demo: Cover all features you have, not just features
          you added recently.</li>
        <li>It is a 'sitting down' demo: As before, you'll be demonstrating the features
          using the TV while sitting down.</li>
        <li>Tutor will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish
          within the given time.</li>
        <li>It should be done by 2 members (i.e. one person do the first half, the
          other do the 2nd half).
          <br>If you are not taking part in this demo, you must take part in V0.5 demo.
          <br>One or more persons can do the typing for the whole demo. Speaking should
          be done by the two designated to do the demo.</li>
        <li>The app should be populated with a significant amount of realistic data
          at the start. e.g data going back to at least two weeks and up to two weeks
          in future, about 50 items in total.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Similar to V0.3</p>

  <h2>V0.5rc : The Release Candidate</h2>
  <div id="handbook-project-v05rc">
    <div>
      <h3>V0.5rc Product</h3>
      <p>Functionality expectations: <strong>Freeze features</strong> after reaching
        this milestone. As this is a ‘release candidate’ it should have all the
        features you intend to release. Adding more features after this point is
        risky. The remaining time should be left aside for fixing problems discovered
        late.
        <br>Other suggestions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dogfood your product intensively and improve it based on your findings.</li>
        <li>Bring code coverage near to your target if it is low.</li>
        <li>After you have sufficient code coverage, fix remaining code quality problems
          and bring up the quality to the level you target.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong>: as before.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Your product should show significant progress
        since the previous milestone.</p>

      <h3>V0.5 Demo</h3>
      <img src="images/v05demo.png" style="width: 250px">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Same as the tutorial venue.</li>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Strictly no more than 12 minutes. Exceeding
          this limit will be penalized.</li>
        <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Your demo timing is same as your tutorial time
          in week 13.
          <br>Starting times: <code>Team B1: 00 minutes, B2: 15 minutes, B3: 30 minutes, B4: 45 minutes</code>
          <br>At least some team members need to arrive 15 minutes ahead of the allocated
          time to set up your computer.
          <br>There is an
          <mark>automatic penalty if you are not ready to start on time.</mark>.</li>
        <li><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level
          manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of
          the product.
          <br>The scenarios you demonstrate should be chosen judiciously so that you
          cover the full range of your product's functionality. Give more time to
          stronger features (i.e. cover mundane/basic features fast). It is recommended
          you showcase how the product improves the user’s workflow rather than simply
          describe each feature.
          <br>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested
          in those details.</li>
        <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but
          it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> All team member should remain in the holding
          area during the tutorial slot (when you are not doing the demo) because
          our testers might need to communicate with you during the testing.
          <br>Holding area for Active Learning Room: Unused area of the room (enter
          by the door near the staircase)
          <br>Holding area for SR5: Tables outside SR5</li>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong>
          <br>Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own
          laptop, using the TV.
          <br>Every team member should take part in the demo. However, it's ok for one
          member to do all the typing.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong>
          <br>Try to make the maximum use of the short demo time in the following ways,
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not
                recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or
                lengthy narrations.
                <br>Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch
                or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to
                get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example,
                [Instead of this]<code>Jim get’s a call from boss. "Ring ring", "hello", "oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?" "Sure". Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code>
                <br>[do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code>
                <br>It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t
                have enough time for it.
                <br>Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context → Different
                requirements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo.
                <mark>Demos that are clearly under-prepared will be penalized.</mark>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If you are not deft with using the laptop’s touchpad, please bring a mouse.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows. Assume
                the target audience knows that the product is a task manager targeting
                Jim-like users. That means no need to explain those things again.
                <br>Also assume the target audience knows who you are. That means no need
                to say things like "We are students from NUS, SoC".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the
                system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo
                itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just a couple
                of sample tasks creates a bad impression too.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For
                example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use,
                show the easiest way to enter a task before you show the full command with
                all the bells and whistles.</p>

        <mark>CS2103T projects will be assessed separately from CS2103 projects.</mark>This
        is to account for the perceived difference in workload. Given below is
        the marking scheme.</p>
      <p><strong>Total</strong>: 50 marks (25 individual marks + 25 team marks)</p>
      <ol>

          <p>Based on the features implemented, how well they fit together to make
            a good product, and how well they are demonstrated.</p>
          <p>‘Half-baked’ (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does
            not go well with the other features) features will not earn marks at all

          <p>Evaluated
            <mark>solely based on what we can learn from the developer guide.</mark>Evaluated
            by lecturer. You will be graded individually on the design of your component

            architecture will affect the grade of all team members.</p>
          <p>Criteria considered:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Conformance with the multi-level top-down approach (i.e. design at high-level
              first, and do the lower-level design of each component later)</li>

          <p><strong>Implementation</strong> [individual][15 marks] - How good is your
            implementation? A measure of the
            <mark>quality and the quantity</mark>of code you have written yourself. On average,
            a student is expected to write 0.5-1.5 KLoC. Evaluated based on an inspection
            of the collated code (submitted in your *.md files) by at least two tutors.
            <br>Criteria considered:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Following SLAP (IMPORTANT).</li>
            <li>Following the coding standard given (IMPORTANT).</li>

            <li>Exception handling.</li>
            <li>Neatness and human readability.Expectations:</li>
            <li>Each person is expected to implement one or more features individually
              in addition to features implemented collectively. Each person is expected
              to write backend code, frontend code, test code, user documentation, and

          <p><strong>QA</strong> [team: 5 marks], [individual: 5 marks] - How good is
            your Quality Assurance? Evaluated based on our own testing. A well written
            user guide and a product that conforms to the user guide (i.e. no bugs)
            will give you a high mark.</p>
          <p>Things considered for team grade: Bugs including validation issues (i.e.
            not meeting project requirements)</p>
          <p>Things considered for individual grade: Quality and quantity of the test
            code in your collated code.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Expectations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production
          environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered
          by tests. In this project, it can be less.</li>
        <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide.
          You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based
          on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly,
          you can decide to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on
          the benefits and the effort required.</li>
        <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better
          to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable
          way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test
          the functional code because the code has low testability.</li>
      </ul>
      <ol start="7">
        <li><strong>Documentation</strong> [team][5 marks] - How well does your user
          guide achieves its objectives? Evaluated by lecturer and TA.
          <br>Criteria considered:
          <ul>
            <li>Explanation should be clear and written to match the audience.</li>
            <li>Good use of visuals to complement text.Note: Developer Guide is graded
              under the 'Design' component.</li>

        <li><strong>Project management</strong> [team: 5 marks][individual: 5 marks]
          - How well you worked together as a team to follow a systematic process?
          <br>For the team component, we look for,
          <ul>
            <li>Good version control, based on the repo.</li>
            <li>Good task definition, assignment and tracking, based on the issue tracker.</li>
            <li>Good use of buffers (opposite: everything at the last minute)</li>
            <li>Iterative (opposite: fake iterative, doing most of the work in one iteration).
              <br>Passed almost all checkpoints from V0.0 to V0.5The individual component
              is determined by peer evaluation from your project team members.</li>

  <h2>Project Supervision</h2>
  <div id="handbook-project-supervision">
    <div>
      <p>Your tutor for phase B will also be your project supervisor.</p>
      <p>Tutorial time is the main avenue for meeting your tutor. In addition,
        you can meet the tutor before/after the tutorial, or any other time, as
        many times you need, subject to availability in his/her schedule. However,
        please note that it is not the tutor’s job to chase you down and give help.
        It is up to you to get as much feedback from the project tutor as you need.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is not the job of the project supervisor to lead your
        project to success. His/job is to observe, evaluate, and give feedback.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Teams of
            <mark>single nationality are not allowed</mark>(rationale: to train you to work
            in multicultural teams). However, we allow same nationality teams if the
            only language common among all team members is English. e.g. an all-Singaporean
            team that include both Chinese and Malay students.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>No more than one exchange students per team (rationale: to increase interaction
            between exchange students and NUS students).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>All team members should be in the same tutorial.

  <h1>Peer Evaluations</h1>
  <div id="handbook-peerEvaluations">
    <div>
      <p>We use the <a href="http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/">TEAMMATES</a> online
        peer evaluation system to conduct several rounds of peer-evaluations. All
        peer evaluations will be taken into account when determining your participation
        marks. The system also allows you to give anonymous feedback to your teammates.</p>
      <span
      id="extra-requirements">
        <p><strong>Extra Requirements:</strong> [considered for participation marks]</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Submitting peer evaluations is compulsory.
            <mark>If you routinely miss submitting peer evaluations, you forfeit your participation
              marks.</mark>
          </li>
          <li>TEAMMATES normally allows students to access it without using Google login.
            In this module, we

          <li>In the profile, you are encouraged (but not compulsory) to provide your
            long term contact email (not school email) as the contact email. This contact

        <panel header="Choosing a profile photo" class="book" expandable="">
          <p>The purpose of the profile photo is for the teaching team to identify
            you. Therefore, you should choose a recent individual photo showing your
            face clearly. Some examples can be seen in the 'Teaching team' page. Given
            below are some examples of good and bad profile photos.</p>

        </span><span id="giving-peer-feedback"><p>Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. <mark>Those who give ineffective feedback will be penalized.</mark></p><p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.</li><li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>) to the same team member is not being honest.</li><li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.</li></ul></span>
        <p>The final peer evaluation will be used to determine the level of contribution
          from each member to the project. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked
          to
          <mark>estimate the contribution of each team member</mark>(including yourself)
          to the project so far.</p>
        <img src="images/peer evaluations.png" width="70%">
        <p>
          <mark>Final peer evaluation affects your grade</mark>in the following way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If there is a general consensus about how much each one contributed, we
            award grades based on the contribution levels submitted through the peer
            evaluation. i.e., if everyone agrees you did more than others, you get
            more marks.</li>
          <li>If there are significant discrepancies in the peer evaluations (e.g.,
            you say you did an [equal share + 20%] while your team says you did an
            [equal share - 10%]), we will investigate further before finalizing project
            marks. For such teams, we are likely to request some or all members to
            <mark>submit an additional individual report</mark>to itemize and quantify the
            contribution to the project.
            <mark>Overclaimers will be penalized.</mark>Please do not claim high just to
            ‘see how’.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Peer evaluations are
          <mark>not visible to undergraduate tutors.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
          <mark>If you disagree with the team’s opinion</mark>, i.e., you think the perceived
          contribution is significantly different from what you actually contributed,
          you can help us grade you fairly by submitting an individual report (‘individual
          report’ is explained under V0.5 deliverables).</p>
        <p>Keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are based
          on team member perceptions and may not reflect your real contribution.
          <mark>We use those numbers primarily to identify cases that need further investigation.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>You may
          <mark>ignore minor variations</mark>in the contribution numbers reported by
          TEAMMATES. For example, the difference between [Equal share] and [Equal
          share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due to rounding off
          within the system.</p>
        <p>Also keep in mind that it is human nature for one to downplay the value
          of contributions from others when one’s own contribution is being compared
          to that of others. As a result, it is common for the ‘perceived contribution’
          to be somewhat lower than what you actually did.</p>
        <p>If you are unhappy about the peer-feedback received and would like to
          make your views known to the team, please allow at least one day to lapse
          before you fire off a response email. You are likely to respond more rationally
          when you had some time to think it over. Also keep in mind that we do take
          note of how well you handle such a situation. You need to act professionally
          when facing conflicting views, opposition, and even deliberate sabotage.</p>

                  will still report it (via the peer-evaluations), and your score will be
                  adjusted all the same. Being open about it on the other hand can save everyone

      <p><strong>Communication</strong>:</p>
      <p>Keeping a record of communications among your team can help you, and us,
        in many ways. We encourage you to do at least some of the project communication
        in written medium (e.g., GitHub Issue Tracker) to practice how to communicate
        technical things in written form.</p>
      <p><strong>Collaboration platform</strong>: We are going to
        <mark>use GitHub as the hosting and collaboration platform</mark>of your project
        (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.). See <a href="#handbook-appendixE-github">Appendix E</a> for
        more info on how to setup and use GitHub for your project.</p>
      <p><strong>IDE</strong>: We
        <mark>require you to use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a>
        </mark>(latest stable release) for module related programming work. Because all
        team members will work on the same code base and project tutors too have
        to go through the code for testing and evaluation, it is troublesome to
        use multiple IDEs. Furthermore, when everyone uses the same tool, it creates
        a bigger collective know-how about the tool which makes troubleshooting
        easier and the productivity higher.</p>
      <p><strong>Revision control</strong>:</p>
      <p>You are required to use Git. Other revision control software are not allowed.
        <br>The recommended GUI client for Git is <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> (which
        comes bundled with Git), but you may use any other, or none.</p>
