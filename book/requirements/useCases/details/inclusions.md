A use case can "include" another use case. Underlined text is commonly used to show an inclusion of a use case. Inclusions are useful,

*	When you don't want to clutter a use case with too many low-level steps.
*	When a set of steps is repeated in multiple use cases.

We use a dotted arrow and a `<< include >>` annotation to show use case inclusions in a use case diagram.
