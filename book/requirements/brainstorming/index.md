### Brainstorming

Brainstorming is a group activity designed to generate a large number of diverse and creative ideas for the solution of a problem. In a brainstorming session there are no "bad" ideas. The aim is to generate ideas; not to validate them. Brainstorming encourages you to "think outside the box" and put "crazy" ideas on the table without fear of rejection.
