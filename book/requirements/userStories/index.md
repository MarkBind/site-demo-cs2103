## User stories

User stories are brief (typically, 1-3 sentences) descriptions of what the system can do for the users, written in the customersâ€™ language. Often, user stories are written by the customers themselves.

A commonly used format for writing user stories is:
 
`As a {user type/role}` `I can {function}` `so that {benefit}`

Here are some examples of user stories for a Learning Management System:

* `As a student, I can download files uploaded by lecturers, so that I can get my own copy of the files`
* `As a lecturer, I can create discussion forums, so that students can discuss things online`
* `As a tutor, I can print attendance sheets, so that I can take attendance during the class`

The `{benefit}` can be omitted if it is obvious. E.g. `As a tutor, I can print attendance sheets.
User stories are mainly used for early estimation and scheduling purposes`. 

According to <trigger for="modal:xp-user-stories" trigger="click">XP</trigger>, the biggest difference between user stories and traditional requirements specifications is in the level of detail. User stories should only provide enough detail to make a reasonably low risk estimate of how long the story will take to implement. When the time comes to implement the story, the developers will meet with the customer face-to-face  to work out a more detailed description of the requirements.
