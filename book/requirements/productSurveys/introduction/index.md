#### Introduction to Product Surveys

<div id="main">

**Studying existing products** can unearth _shortcomings of existing solutions that can be addressed_ by a new product. For example, when developing a game for a mobile device, a look at a similar PC game can give insight into the kind of features and interactions the mobile game might offer. Product manuals and other forms of technical documentation of an existing system can be a good way to learn about how the existing solutions work.
