#### Introduction

<div id="main">

Focus groups are a kind of informal interview within an interactive group setting. A group of people (e.g. potential users, beta testers) are asked about their understanding of a specific issue or a process.  Focus groups can bring out undiscovered conflicts and misunderstandings among stakeholder interests which can then be resolved or clarified as necessary.
