      <h2 id="what-are-software-requirements">What are software requirements?</h2>
      <p>A requirement specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product.</p>
      <p>A software project may be,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <em>brown-field</em> project: develop a product to replace/update an existing software product</li>
        <li>a <em>green-field</em> project: develop a totally new system with no precedent</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In either case, requirements have to be understood, discussed, refined, clarified, <em>scoped</em>.</p>
      <p>Requirements come from <em>stakeholders</em>. {more}</p>
      <p>Identifying requirements is not as straightforward as it sounds. It is not as simple as writing a wish list. {more details}</p>

    <div>
      <h2 id="functional-vs-non-functional-requirments">Functional vs non-functional requirments</h2>
      <p>There are two different kinds of requirements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Functional requirements</strong> specify what the system should do.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong> specify the constraints under which system is developed and operated. Some examples of non-functional requirements:</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>Data requirements e.g. size, volatility, persistency etc.,</li>
        <li>Environment requirements e.g. technical environment in which system would operate or need to be compatible with.</li>
        <li>Accessibility, Capacity, Compliance with regulations, Documentation, Disaster recovery, Efficiency, Extensibility, Fault tolerance, Interoperability, Maintainability, Privacy, Portability, Quality, Reliability, Response time, Robustness, Scalability,
          Security, Stability, Testability, and moreâ€¦</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Non-functional requirements are easier to miss. We should spend extra effort in digging them out as early as possible because sometimes they are critical to the success of the software. E.g. A web application that is too slow or that has low security
        is unlikely to succeed even if it has all the right functionalities.</p>

    <div>
      <h2 id="prioritizing-requirements">Prioritizing requirements</h2>
      <p>Short timelines and limited resources often mean that you cannot implement all requirements at once. A prioritization criterion can be used to gauge the importance and urgency of requirements from the user point of view, while keeping in mind the
        constraints of schedule, budget, staff resources, and quality goals as seen by the development team.</p>
      <p>A common approach to prioritization is to group requirements into priority categories. Note that all such scales are subjective, and stakeholders define the meaning of each level in the scale for the project at hand.</p>
      <p>Here is an example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Essential</code>: The product must have this requirement fulfilled else it does not get user acceptance</li>
        <li><code>Typical</code>: Most similar systems have this feature although the product can survive without it.</li>
        <li><code>Novel</code>: New features that could differentiate this product from the rest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>High</code>, <code>Medium</code>, <code>Low</code></li>
        <li><code>Must-have</code>, <code>Nice-to-have</code>, <code>Unlikely-to-have</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>At the same time, some requirements may get discarded as they are considered â€˜out of scopeâ€™.</p>

  <panel header="**Quality of requirements** :one:" type="seamless" alt="quality">
    <div>
      <h2 id="quality-of-requirements">Quality of requirements</h2>
      <p>Here are some characteristics of well-defined requirements (as given in [2]):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unambiguous</li>
        <li>Testable (verifiable)</li>
        <li>Clear (concise, terse, simple, precise)</li>
        <li>Correct</li>
        <li>Understandable</li>
        <li>Feasible (realistic, possible)</li>
        <li>Independent</li>
        <li>Atomic</li>
        <li>Necessary</li>
        <li>Implementation-free (abstract)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Besides these criteria for individual requirements, the set of requirements as a whole should be</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consistent</li>
        <li>Non-redundant</li>
        <li>Complete</li>
