## Quality of requirements

Here are some characteristics of well-defined requirements (as given in [2]):
* Unambiguous
* Testable (verifiable)
* Clear (concise, terse, simple, precise)
* Correct
* Understandable
* Feasible (realistic, possible)
* Independent
* Atomic
* Necessary
* Implementation-free (abstract)

Besides these criteria for individual requirements, the set of requirements as a whole should be
* Consistent
* Non-redundant
* Complete
