    <p><strong>FAQ</strong>: Why is this topic covered so late in the semester?
      <br><strong>Answer</strong>: We want you to try a design without patterns
      first, and then, refactor the design to introduce patterns. That way, you
      can not only see the difference, but also get to practice refactoring.</p>

    <p>In software development, there are certain problems that crop up repeatedly.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An example problem about software architecture: what is the best architecture
        for a given type of system?</li>
      <li>An example problem about the interaction between classes: how to lower
        the coupling between UI and Logic classes?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After repeated attempts at solving such problems, better solutions are
      discovered and refined over time. These solutions are collectively known
      as <em>patterns</em>, a term popularized by the seminal book <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em> by
      the so-called “Gang of Four” (GoF): Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson
      and John Vlissides.</p>

    <p>Instead of listing a large number of patterns, this handout attempts to
      guide the reader on understanding patterns as a general concept by referring
      to a few representative examples to illustrate the concept of patterns.
      This handout focuses more on patterns in the area of software design (i.e.
      design patterns). Having understood the general idea of patterns, the reader
      should be able to pick up more patterns from other resources.</p>
    <p>The common format to describe a pattern consists of the following components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Context</strong>: The situation or scenario where the design problem
        is encountered.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem</strong>: The main difficulty to be resolved. The criteria
        for a good solution are also identified to evaluate solutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Solution</strong>: The core of the solution. It is important to
        note that the solution presented only includes the most general constraints,
        which may need further refinement for a specific context.</li>
      <li><strong>Anti-patterns</strong> (optional): Commonly used solutions, which
        are usually incorrect and/or inferior to the Design Pattern.</li>
      <li><strong>Consequences</strong> (optional): Identifying the pros and cons
        of applying the pattern.</li>
      <li><strong>Other useful information</strong> (optional): Code examples, known
        uses, other related patterns, etc.</li>

      <h3 id="abstraction-occurrence-pattern">Abstraction occurrence pattern</h3>
      <h4 id="context">Context</h4>
      <p>There is a group of similar entities that appears to be ‘occurrences’
        (or ‘copies’) of the same thing, sharing lots of common information, but
        also differing in significant ways.</p>
      <p>For example, in a library, there can be multiple copies of same book title.
        Each copy shares common information such as <code>book title</code>, <code>author</code>,
        <tooltip
        content="International Standard Book Number"><a href=""><code>ISBN</code></a>
          </tooltip>etc. However, there are also significant differences like <code>purchase date</code> and <code>barcode number</code> (assumed
          to be unique for each copy of the book). Other examples include episodes
          of the same TV series and stock items of the same product model (e.g. TV
          sets of the same model).</p>
      <h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
      <p>Representing the objects mentioned previously as a single class would
        be problematic (refer to anti-pattern description below). A better way
        to represent such instances is required, which should avoid duplicating
        the common information. Without duplicated information, inconsistency is
        avoided should these common information be changed.</p>
      <h4 id="anti-patterns">Anti-patterns</h4>
      <img src="abstraction-occurrence/antipattern1.png" class="center-block">
      <p>Take for example the problem of representing books in a library. Assume
        that there could be multiple copies of the same title, bearing the same
        ISBN number, but different serial numbers. The above diagram shows an inferior
        or incorrect design for this problem. It requires common information to
        be duplicated by all instances. This will not only waste storage space,
        but also creates a consistency problem. Suppose that after creating several
        copies of the same title, the librarian realized that the author name was
        wrongly spelt. To correct this mistake, the system needs to go through
        every copy of the same title to make the correction. Also, if a new copy
        of the title is added later on, the librarian has to make sure that all
        information entered is the same as the existing copies to avoid inconsistency.</p>
      <img
      src="abstraction-occurrence/antipattern2.png" class="center-block">
        <p>The design above segregates the common and unique information into a class
          hierarchy. Each book title is represented by a separate class with common
          data (i.e. <code>Name</code>, <code>Author</code>,
          <tooltip content="International Standard Book Number"><a href=""><code>ISBN</code></a>
          </tooltip>) hard-coded in the class itself. This solution is worse than the first
          as each book title is represented as a class, resulting in thousands of
          classes. Every time the library buys new books, the source code of the
          system will have to be updated with new classes.</p>
        <h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
        <p>The solution is to let a book copy be represented by two objects instead
          of one, as given below.</p>
        <img src="abstraction-occurrence/solution1.png"
        class="center-block">
        <p>In this solution, the common and unique information are separated into
          two classes to avoid duplication. Given below is another example that contrasts
          the two situations <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> applying the pattern.</p>
        <img
        src="abstraction-occurrence/solution2.png" class="center-block">
          <p>The general idea can be found in the following class diagram:
            <img src="abstraction-occurrence/classdiagram.png"
            class="center-block">
          </p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;&lt;Abstraction&gt;&gt;</code> class should hold all common
            information, and the unique information should be kept by the <code>&lt;&lt;Occurrence&gt;&gt;</code> class.
            Note that ‘Abstraction’ and ‘Occurrence’ are not class names, but roles
            played by each class. Think of this diagram as a <em>meta-model</em> (i.e.
            a ‘model of a model’) of the <code>BookTitle-BookCopy</code> class diagram
            given above.</p>

      <h3 id="singleton-pattern">Singleton Pattern</h3>
      <h4 id="context-2">Context</h4>
      <p>In most systems, it is common to restrict the number of instantiated objects
        of certain classes to just <strong>one</strong> (e.g. the main controller
        class of the system). These single instances are commonly known as <em>singletons</em>.</p>
      <h4
      id="problem-2">Problem</h4>
        <p>Prohibit the instantiation of more than one object from a singleton class,
          with the single instance easily shared among those who need it.</p>
        <h4
        id="solution-2">Solution</h4>
          <p>The key insight of the solution is that the <em>constructor</em> of the
            singleton class cannot be <em>public</em>. Since a <em>public constructor</em> will
            allow others to instantiate the class at will, a <em>private constructor</em> should
            be used instead. In addition, a public method is provided to access the <em>single</em> instance.
            This solution is described below.</p>
          <img class="center-block" src="singleton/solution.png">
          <p>As shown, the solution makes the constructor private (note the “-“ visibility
            marker for the constructor), which prevents instantiation from outside
            the class. The single instance of the singleton class is maintained by
            a private class-level variable. Access to this object is provided by a
            public class-level operation getInstance(). In the skeleton code above, <code>getInstance()</code> instantiates
            a single copy of the singleton class when it is executed for the first
            time. Subsequent calls to this operation return the single instance of
            the class.</p>

      <h3 id="command-pattern">Command Pattern</h3>
      <h4 id="context-4">Context</h4>
      <p>A system is required to execute a number of commands, each doing a different
        task. For example, a system might have to support <code>Sort</code>, <code>List</code>,
        Reset commands.</p>
      <h4 id="problem-4">Problem</h4>
      <p>It is preferable that some part of the code execute these commands without
        having to know each command type. For example, there can be a <code>CommandQueue</code> object
        that is responsible for queuing commands and executing them without knowledge
        of what each command does.</p>
      <h4 id="solution-4">Solution</h4>
      <p>In the example solution below, the CommandCreator creates <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>,
        and <code>Reset</code> Command objects and adds them to the <code>CommandQueue</code> object.
        The <code>CommandQueue</code> object treats them all as <code>Command</code> objects
        and performs the <code>execute/undo</code> operation on each of them without
        knowledge of the specific Command type. When executed, each <code>Command</code> object
        will access the <code>DataStore</code> object to carry out its task. The <code>Command</code> class
        can also be an abstract class or an interface.</p>
      <img class="center-block"
      src="command/solution1.png">
      <p>The general form of the solution is as follows.</p>
      <img class="center-block"
      src="command/solution2.png">
      <p>The <code>&lt;&lt;Client&gt;&gt;</code> creates a <code>&lt;&lt;ConcreteCommand&gt;&gt;</code> object,
        and passes it to the <code>&lt;&lt;Invoker&gt;&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;&lt;Invoker&gt;&gt;</code> object
        treats all commands as a general <code>&lt;&lt;Command&gt;&gt;</code> type.
<code>&lt;&lt;Invoker&gt;&gt;</code> issues
        a request by calling <code>execute()</code> on the command. If a command
        is undoable, <code>&lt;&lt;ConcreteCommand&gt;&gt;</code> will store the
        state for undoing the command prior to invoking execute(). In addition,
        the <code>&lt;&lt;ConcreteCommand&gt;&gt;</code> object may have to be linked
        to any <code>&lt;&lt;Receiver&gt;&gt;</code> of the command before it is
        passed to the <code>&lt;&lt;Invoker&gt;&gt;</code>. Note that an application

    <h4 id="context-5">Context</h4>
    <p>Most applications support storage/retrieval of information, displaying

      and changing stored information based on external inputs.</p>
    <h4 id="problem-5">Problem</h4>

    <h4 id="solution-5">Solution</h4>
    <p>To decouple data, presentation, and control logic of an application by
      separating them into three different components: Model, View and Controller.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>View: Displays data, interacts with the user, and pulls data from the
        model if necessary.</li>
      <li>Controller: Detects UI events such as mouse clicks, button pushes and
        takes follow up action. Updates/changes the model/view when necessary.</li>
      <li>Model: Stores and maintains data. Updates views if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The relationship between the components can be observed in the diagram
      below. Typically, the UI is the combination of view and controller.</p>
    <img
    class="center-block" src="mvc/solution1.png">
      <p>Given below is a concrete example of MVC applied to a <em>student management system</em>.
        In this scenario, the user is retrieving data of one student.</p>
      <img class="center-block"

      <p>In the diagram above, when the user clicks on a button using the UI, the
        ‘click’ event is caught and handled by the UiController.</p>
      <p>Note that in a simple UI where there’s only one view, Controller and View
        can be combined as one class.</p>
      <p>There are many variations of the MVC model used in different domains.
        For example, the one used in a desktop GUI could be different from the

    <p>Here is another scenario from the same student management system where
      the user is adding a new student to the system.</p>
    <img class="center-block"
    src="observer/intro.png">
    <p>Now, assume the system has two additional <em>views</em> used in parallel
      by different users:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) <code>StudentListUi</code> : that accesses a list of students and</li>
      <li>(b) <code>StudentStatsUi</code> : that generates statistics of current students.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When a student is added to the database using <em>NewStudentUi</em> shown
      above, both <em>StudentListUi</em> and <em>StudentStatsUi</em> should get updated
      automatically, as shown below.</p>
    <img class="center-block" src="observer/intro2.png">
    <p>However, the <code>StudentList</code> object has no knowledge about <code>StudentListUi</code> and <code>StudentStatsUi</code> (note
      the direction of the navigability) and has no way to inform those objects.
      This is an example of the type of problem addressed by the <strong>Observer pattern</strong>.</p>
    <h4
    id="context-6">Context</h4>
      <p>An object (possibly, more than one) is interested to get notified when
        a change happens to another object. That is, some objects want to ‘observe’
        another object.</p>
      <h4 id="problem-6">Problem</h4>
      <p>A bidirectional link between the two objects is not desirable. However
        the two entities need to communicate with each other. That is, the ‘observed’
        object does not want to be coupled to objects that are ‘observing’ it.</p>
      <h4
      id="solution-6">Solution</h4>
        <p>The <em>Observer</em> pattern shows us how an object can communicate with
          other objects while avoiding a direct coupling with them.</p>
        <p>The solution is to force the communication through an interface known
          to both parties. A concrete example is given below.</p>
        <img class="center-block"
        src="observer/solution1.png">
        <p>Here is the Observer pattern applied to the student management system.</p>
        <p>During initialization of the system,</p>
        <p>1.First, create the relevant objects.</p><pre><code>StudentList studentList = new StudentList(); 
StudentListUi listUi = new StudentListUi(); 
StudentStatusUi statusUi = new StudentStatsUi();
</code></pre>
        <p>2.Next, the two UIs indicate to the <code>StudentList</code> that they are
          interested in being updated whenever StudentList changes. This is also
          known as ‘subscribing for updates’.</p><pre><code>studentList.addUi(listUi);
studentList.addUi(statusUi);
</code></pre>
        <p>Within the addUi operation of <code>StudentList</code>, all Observer objects
          subscribers are added to an internal data structure called <code>observerList</code>.</p><pre><code>//StudentList class
public void addUi(Observer o) { 
    observerList.add(o);
}
</code></pre>
        <p>As such, whenever the data in <code>StudentList</code> changes (e.g. when
          a new student is added to the <code>StudentList</code>), all interested
          observers are updated by calling the <code>notifyUIs</code> operation.</p><pre><code>//StudentList class
public void notifyUIs() {
for(Observer o: observerList) //for each observer in the list
    o.update();
}
</code></pre>
        <p>UIs can then pull data from the StudentList whenever the update operation
          is called.</p><pre><code>//StudentListUI class
public void update() {
    //refresh UI by pulling data from StudentList
}
</code></pre>
        <p>Note that <code>StudentList</code> is unaware of the exact nature of the
          two UIs but still manages to communicate with them via an intermediary.</p>
        <p>Here is the generic description of the observer pattern:</p>
        <img class="center-block"
        src="observer/solution2.png">
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;</code> is an interface: any class that implements
            it can observe an <code>&lt;&lt;Observable&gt;&gt;</code>. Any number of <code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;</code> objects
            can observe (i.e. listen to changes of) the <code>&lt;&lt;Observable&gt;&gt;</code> object.</li>
          <li>The <code>&lt;&lt;Observable&gt;&gt;</code> maintains a list of <code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;</code> objects. <code>addObserver(Observer)</code> operation
            adds a new <code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;</code> to the list of <code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;</code>s.</li>
          <li>Whenever there is a change in the <code>&lt;&lt;Observable&gt;</code>,
            the <code>notifyObservers()</code> operation is called that will call the <code>update()</code> operation
            of all <code>&lt;&lt;Observer&gt;&gt;</code>s in the list.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In a GUI application, how is the Controller notified when the “save” button
          is clicked? UI frameworks such as JavaFX has inbuilt support for the Observer
          pattern.</p>

  <h3 id="beyond-design-patterns">Beyond design patterns</h3>
  <p>The notion of capturing design ideas as &quot;patterns&quot; is usually
    attributed to Christopher Alexander. He is a building architect noted for
    his theories about design. His book Timeless way of building talks about
    “design patterns” for constructing buildings.</p>
  <p>Here is a sample pattern from that book:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When a room has a window with a view, the window becomes a focal point:
      people are attracted to the window and want to look through it. The furniture
      in the room creates a second focal point: everyone is attracted toward
      whatever point the furniture aims them at (usually the center of the room
      or a TV). This makes people feel uncomfortable. They want to look out the
      window, and toward the other focus at the same time. If you rearrange the
      furniture, so that its focal point becomes the window, then everyone will
      suddenly notice that the room is much more “comfortable”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Apparently, patterns and anti-patterns are found in the field of building
    architecture. This is because they are general concepts applicable to any
    domain, not just software design. In software engineering, there are many
    general types of patterns: Analysis patterns, Design patterns, Testing
    patterns, Architectural patterns, Project management patterns, and so on.</p>
  <p>In fact, the abstraction occurrence pattern is more of an analysis pattern
    than a design pattern, while MVC is more of an architectural pattern.</p>
  <p>New patterns can be created too. If a common problem needs to be solved
    frequently that leads to a non-obvious and better solution, it can be formulated
    as a pattern so that it can be reused by others. However, don’t reinvent
    the wheel; the pattern might already exist.</p>
  <p>The more patterns one acquires, the more ‘experienced’ he/she is. Exposing
    oneself to a multitude of patterns (at least the context and problem) is
    a must. Some patterns are domain- specific (e.g. patterns for distributed
    applications), some are created in-house (e.g. patterns the company/project)
    and some can be self-created (e.g. from past experience). However, most
    are common, and well known. As an example, GoF book contains 23 design
    patterns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Creational</strong>: About object creation. They separate the
      operation of an application from how its objects are created.
      <ul>
        <li>Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype, Singleton</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Structural</strong>: About the composition of objects into larger
      structures while catering for future extension in structure.
      <ul>
        <li>Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Façade, Flyweight, Proxy</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Behavioral</strong>: Defining how objects interact and how responsibility
      is distributed among them.
      <ul>
        <li>Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Template Method, Iterator,
          Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Visitor</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>When using patterns, be careful not to overuse them. Do not throw patterns
    at a problem at every opportunity. Patterns come with overhead such as
    adding more classes or increasing the levels of abstraction. Use them only
    when they are needed. Before applying a pattern, make sure that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>there is substantial improvement in the design, not just superficial.</li>
    <li>the associated tradeoffs are carefully considered. There are times when
      a design pattern is not appropriate (or an overkill).</li>
  </ul>

<panel header="&lt;strong&gt;Case Study&lt;/strong&gt;" expandable="">
  <div>
    <h3 id="case-study">Case Study</h3>
    <p>Next, let us look at a case study that shows how design patterns are used
      in the design of a class structure for a Stock Inventory System (SIS) for
      a shop. The shop sells appliances, and accessories for the appliances.
      SIS simply stores information about each item in the store.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Use cases: create a new item, view information about an item, modify information
        about an item, view all available accessories for a given appliance, list
        all items in the store.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>SIS can be accessed using multiple terminals. Shop assistants use their
      own terminals to access SIS, while the shop manager’s terminal continuously
      displays a list of all items in store. In the future, it is expected that
      suppliers of items use their own applications to connect to SIS to get
      real-time information about current stock status. User authentication is
      not required for the current version, but may be required in the future.</p>
    <p>A step by step explanation of the design is given below. Note that this
      is one out of many possible designs. Design patterns are also applied where
      appropriate.</p>
    <p>Here is a step-through of the design:</p>
    <p>A <code>StockItem</code> can be an <code>Appliance</code> or an <code>Accessory</code>.</p>
    <img
    src="case-study/1.png" class="center-block">
      <p>To track that each Accessory is associated with the correct <code>Appliance</code>,
        consider the following alternative class structures.</p>
      <img src="case-study/2.png"
      class="center-block">
      <p>The third one seems more appropriate (the second one is suitable if accessories
        can have accessories). Next, consider between keeping a list of <code>Appliances</code>,
        and a list of <code>StockItems</code>. Which is more appropriate?</p>
      <img
      src="case-study/3.png" class="center-block">
        <p>The latter seems more suitable because it can handle both appliances and
          accessories the same way. Next, an abstraction occurrence pattern is applied
          to keep track of <code>StockItems</code>.</p>
        <img src="case-study/4.png"
        class="center-block">
        <p>Note the inclusion of navigabilities. Here’s a sample object diagram based
          on the class model created thus far.</p>
        <img src="case-study/5.png" class="center-block">
        <p>Next, apply the <em>façade pattern</em> to shield the SIS internals from
          the UI.</p>
        <img src="case-study/6.png" class="center-block">
        <p>As UI consists of multiple views, the MVC pattern is applied here.</p>
        <img
        src="case-study/7.png" class="center-block">
          <p>Some views need to be updated when the data change; apply the Observer
            pattern here.</p>
          <img src="case-study/8.png" class="center-block">
          <p>In addition, the Singleton pattern can be applied to the façade class.</p>
