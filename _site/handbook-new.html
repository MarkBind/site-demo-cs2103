        <p><strong>Where is everything?</strong> CS2103/T-related information are
          mainly in one of these two places:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong><a href="index.html">Schedule page</a></strong> (organized chronologically):
            That is the one page you need to refer weekly.</li>
          <li><strong>Module handbook</strong> (i.e. this page. organized by topic) This
            is a reference document supplementary to the schedule page. This page contains
            a lot of text, probably too much to read in one sitting. Instead,
            <mark>skim through it quickly to learn what it contains.</mark>You can come
            back to read details as-and-when the need arises. The schedule page lists
            relevant sections of the Handbook you should read at various points.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>No reminder emails</strong>: We try to minimize sending module
          details via announcements. The reason will be explained in lecture 1.</p>
        <p><strong>CS2103 Vs CS2103T</strong>: Same lectures, same exam. Separate
          tutorials, separate project grading. Unless specified otherwise, whatever
          is stated for one module applies to the other.</p>
        <p><strong>What did seniors say about this module?</strong> CS2103/T is <strong>practical</strong> and <strong>useful</strong> module,
          but also a <strong>heavy</strong> and <strong>intensive</strong> module, as
          you can see from <a href="">student feedback for a recent offering of the module</a>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h1 id="lectures">Lectures</h1>
    <div id="handbook-lectures">
      <div>
        <img src="images/Lecture photo.png" style="width: 713px;">
        <p><strong>Timing/venue</strong>: Fri 1400-1600 ICube Auditorium. Lectures
          start at 1400 sharp and end around 1545 (15 minutes to travel to next lecture).</p>
        <p><strong>Attendance</strong>: Attendance for the
          <mark>first lecture is compulsory</mark>.</p>
        <p><strong>Webcast</strong>: All lectures will be webcast. However, some
          things are not captured well in the webcast recording. You are advised
          to treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed
          during the lecture.</p>
        <p><strong>Handouts</strong>: Each lecture consists of 3-5 sections, supported
          by separate handouts. Links to handouts for a lecture will be
          <mark>added to the Schedule page on Wednesday</mark>of that week. You are welcome
          to, but not required to, read through them before attending the lecture.</p>
        <p>
          <mark><strong>Read before tutorials</strong>
          </mark>: You are required to read the relevant handouts and ponder how to apply
          those concepts in your project before attending the corresponding tutorial.
          If you have any followup questions about handouts, please post in IVLE
          forums or ask during tutorials (if there is spare time).</p>
        <p><strong>Post-lecture quizzes</strong>: Each lecture will be followed by
          an IVLE quiz that can earn you participation points. Purpose: for you to
          self-test how well you understood the handouts and other “required” readings
          (if any). You can keep taking the quiz until you get full marks. We count
          the best effort only. IVLE quizzes open on Friday right after the lecture
          and closes on the following Tuesday 2359. Post-lecture quizzes are
          <mark>counted for <a href="#participation">participation marks</a>
          </mark>.</p>
        <p><strong>Slides</strong>: Because we are giving separate handouts, lecture
          slides do not contain content that you can print and use as a reference
          during the lecture or the exams. Instead, handouts serve as the main exam
          reference while slides will play only a supporting role during lecture
          delivery. Slides will be uploaded <em>after</em> the lecture.</p>

    <h1 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h1>
    <div id="handbook-tutorials">
      <div>
        <p>
          <mark>IMPORTANT: Our tutorials start on week 2 (even before CORS tutorial bidding
            is over), not in week 3 as other modules do. CS2103 (not CS2103T) students
            need to choose a temporary tutorial slot for week 2 tutorial. We'll inform
            you the procedure to do so in due course.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>The structure of our tutorials is different from traditional tutorials.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>50% assessment/feedback</strong>: Up to 50% of our tutorial time
            is to be spent on interacting with your tutor as directed by the tutor.
            The purpose of this interaction is for the tutor to assess learning activities
            you claim to have done and give you feedback.</li>
          <li><strong>50% discussion</strong>: The remaining 50% of the tutorial time
            is to be spent on discussing module activities with team members and helping
            each other w.r.t. those activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The role of our tutors</strong> is different from tutors in other
          modules.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No direct tech help</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from giving
            technical help, because we want you to learn the vital survival skill of
            troubleshooting technical problems.
            <br><span class="dimmed">[cf Appendix D: How to get tech help]</span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>No ‘teaching’</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from “teaching”
            concepts that are covered in lectures or handouts. Self-learning is a vital
            part of the module. But tutors may help you clarify doubts. For example
            consider these two questions you might want to ask a tutor:
            <ul>
              <li><em>This is how I understood/applied dependency injection. Is that correct?</em> -
                Such questions are welcome.
                <br><strong>Reason</strong>:This question shows you have put in some effort
                to learn the topic and seeking further clarification from the tutor.</li>
              <li><em>What is dependency injection?</em> - Such questions are not welcome.
                <br><strong>Reason</strong>: This question implies you haven’t done what you
                could to learn the topic in concern.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>No leading from the front</strong>: Tutors are not expected to
          lead your project effort. They will not tell you how to do project tasks
          or when to do project tasks. You have to figure those out yourselves. But
          tutors will give you feedback on how you are doing (or have done) project
          tasks so that you can improve further.
          <br><span class="dimmed">[Cf external resource: <a href="">A practitioner article about receiving feedback</a>]</span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Timing/venue:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Please refer to the Schedule page for further details on each tutorial.</li>
          <li>You are expected to arrive on time.
            <ul>
              <li>If your tutorial is in <strong>COM1-B103</strong>: If you arrive early,
                you may enter the tutorial room by the door near the staircase and wait
                in the empty area of the room until the current class vacates the room.</li>
              <li>If your tutorial is in <strong>SR5</strong>: If you arrive early, please
                wait outside the room until you are asked to come in.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another
            class right after. There is no need to wait till the tutor dismisses you.
            However, inform the tutor before leaving if you leave before the class
            is dismissed.</li>
          <li>Please make sure you
            <mark>vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour</mark>so that the next group
            can start on time. You may move to the empty area at the back of the room
            and continue your discussions after the class is over.</li>
          <li>In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration
            because 1 hour is barely enough to get through all the tutorial tasks.
            Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and
            tutors. What you can do is to extend the tutorial time by yourselves. e.g.
            Meet 30 minutes before the tutorial starts and prepare yourselves for the
            tutorial task. Similarly, you can move your discussion to somewhere else
            after the tutorial is over and continue for some more time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Learning activities:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Each tutorial has a list of learning activities. They are categorized
          as,</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>BASIC</strong> (⭐️) : Cover skills you should have if you want
            to PASS the module.</li>
          <li><strong>INTERMEDIATE</strong> (⭐️⭐️) : Cover skills you should have if
            you are aiming for a GOOD grade from this module, and a good career as
            a software engineer.</li>
          <li><strong>ADVANCED</strong> (⭐️⭐️⭐️) : Cover skills beyond the module syllabus.
            These are for students who want to go the extra mile to strengthen their
            skills.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Grading:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The following aspects of your conduct in tutorials will be considered
          when awarding participation marks. Grading is based on peer evaluations
          and tutor observations. Cf handbook section: Participation marks</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Punctuality</strong>: Arrived on time. Stayed in the tutorial
            at least 40 minutes.
            <br><span class="dimmed">Cf FAQ: <a href="">Why do I have to attend tutorials on time?</a></span>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Attention</strong>: Paid undivided attention to tutorial proceedings
            (i.e. no multi tasking). Took part in tutorial activities.
            <br>Note: When the tutor is discussing something with one team member (e.g.,
            one team member is explaining how he/she used assertions), <strong>the whole team is expected to pay attention</strong> to
            that discussion, not do your own things. Whatever discussed is relevant
            to all of you, not just that team member.</li>
          <li><strong>Effort</strong>: The amount of learning activities done before
            and during the tutorial.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Other expectations:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Please bring your laptop to tutorials.</strong> You often need
            it to show your learning activity results. At other times, we ask you to
            work on project related things with your team members, which too may require
            the laptop. <span class="dimmed">Cf FAQ: <a href="">What if I don't carry a laptop around?</a></span>

        <p>CS2103 project is structured to resemble the initial stages of a non-trivial
          real-life software project. In this project you will conceptualize a product
          and build a scaled-down version of the product, and
          <mark>have it ready to be continued by someone else</mark>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2 id="the-product">The product</h2>
    <div id="handbook-project-product">
      <div>
        <p>In this semester, we build a scaled-down version of ‘a Siri for keyboards’.
          i.e. a tool that can accept natural language commands via keyboard. This
          is for folks who can type fast, spend most of the time near a computer,
          and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands.</p>
        <p>It is ‘scaled down’ in the following ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It handles only commands related to managing the user's schedule and todo
            tasks.</li>
          <li>The commands will not be truly ‘natural language’. The command format
            will be flexible, but still quite structured. NLP (Natural Language Processing)
            is not required.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let us use the generic term 'Task Manager' to refer to this product. You
          should give it a different name yourself.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem outline</strong>: We are bombarded with ‘things to do’
          continuously. Some things need to be done during specific times (e.g.,
          attend meeting), some have deadlines (e.g., submit report), and others
          are simply ‘to be done someday’ (e.g., read ‘Lord of the Rings’). The pile
          of todo items accumulates and weighs heavily on our mind at times. Sometimes
          things go out of control and we forget to do certain things on time.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution outline</strong>: The software should help user to put
          these todo items into a systematic process that tracks them and helps the
          user to decide what to do and when to do things so that the user doesn’t
          have to remember the todo items.</p>
        <p><strong>Target audience</strong>: There are many similar software that
          tackles some aspect of this problem (todo lists software, calendar software,
          GTD software). Because it is a crowded product space, our strategy is to
          become a niche player by targeting a specific user group. Our target users
          are people like Jim whose workflow is described below.</p>
        <img src="images/Jim at his computer.png"
        style="width: 500px;">
        <p>Most of Jim’s todo items arrive as emails. This is how Jim processes his
          emails.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Decides what is the follow up action required by that email.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If it can be done immediately, he does it right away (e.g., just reply
                to the email) and ‘archive’ the email (i.e. move it out of inbox).</li>
              <li>If it cannot be done immediately, he schedules the follow up action in
                his calendar and archives the email. If he cannot decide a good time to
                do the action, he simply schedules it in a relatively free area in his
                calendar.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When Jim is free to do some work, he looks at his calendar and picks up
              something that he can do at that time. Once the task is done, he marks
              it as ‘done’. If there is a further follow up action required, he schedules
              it in the calendar.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Jim periodically reviews the calendar to pick items that could not be
              completed and need to be rescheduled or discarded as ‘cannot do’.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Todo items not arising from email are dealt similarly by entering them
              in the calendar.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>As you can see from the above workflow, Jim’s inbox is almost empty most
          of time (<span class="dimmed">cf <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero">Inbox Zero</a></span>).
          He no longer worries about an inbox full of emails he has to deal with
          at any time he login to email. He also does not have to keep any todo items
          in his mind because everything is recorded somewhere. However, here are
          some ‘pain points’ in his workflow.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Jim is currently using Google calendar. Because he stores/retrieves/edits
            todo tasks so frequently, he finds the online calendar too slow to work
            with. He’d rather have a desktop software he can summon quickly. Even better
            (but not a must) if he can activate the software by pressing a keyboard
            shortcut. He is quite impressed by how the <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy tool can be activated easily by pressing Alt+Space</a>.</li>
          <li>A calendar is not very good in capturing tasks that need to be done before
            a specific date/time, or after a specific date/time, and items without
            specific times.</li>
          <li>Entering an event in a calendar is a pain because it takes several clicks.
            He prefers a ‘one shot’ approach. e.g., to be able to type in commands
            such as &quot;<code>add July 10, 5-6, project meeting</code>&quot; (such
            as allowed by <a href="http://gappstips.com/google-calendar/use-quick-add-to-speed-up-google-calendar-entries/">GCal’s ‘quick add’ feature</a>).</li>
          <li>While it is good that all Jim’s todo items are currently online and available
            to access from any computer, he always uses his own laptop or office PC
            to access them and sometimes from places where there is no ready Internet
            connectivity.</li>
          <li>Jim finds it a pain to do certain things important to his workflow but
            not so important in a regular calendar. e.g. looking for suitable slot
            to schedule an item, marking an item as done, deciding what todo item to
            do next, postponing an item.</li>
          <li>A calendar does not have an easy way to “block” multiple slots when the
            exact timing of a task is uncertain, and release the blocked slots when
            the time is finalized. e.g., Block Mon 2-3pm and Tue 2-3pm for a meeting
            with boss → the meeting is confirmed for Tue → automatically release Mon
            slot.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Design your product to solve some of Jim’s problems to make his workflow
          even more efficient and painless. i.e. to make his life better. You don’t
          have to solve all problems mentioned above and there may be other problems
          you could solve but not mentioned above. Good software delights users by
          solving problems users don’t even realize they have.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong>
          <mark>Command Line Interface is the primary mode of input.</mark>The GUI is
          primarily for output. That is, the GUI is used to give visual feedback
          rather than to collect input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to
          click the minimize button), but the primary input should be command-driven.
          Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and typing is preferred
          over key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster
          by typing compared to mouse or key combinations.</p>

    <h2 id="project-scope">Project Scope</h2>
    <div id="handbook-project-scope">
      <div>
        <p>The scope of the project will be restricted. This is to reduce your workload
          and discourage an ‘arms race’ where you try to implement as many features
          as possible with no time to spend on learning good software engineering
          principles and practices.</p>
        <p>Write the software to cater to Jim. He is an office worker who has an
          office computer (used when at office) and his personal laptop (used when
          at home or travelling). His computers are not shared by other colleagues
          or family members. He is not expected to use this software for collaborative
          work scheduling with others.</p>
        <p>
          <mark>Narrowing/widening the scope of the project further is discouraged.</mark>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Must-have features:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Support for events (i.e., has a start time and end time), deadlines (tasks
            that have to be done before a specific deadline), and floating tasks (tasks
            without specific times). Note that these category names are temporary names
            only. You should figure out what are the best names for these categories.
            Are these names intuitive to end-users? Should they even care about consciously
            categorizing tasks?</li>
          <li>CRUD (i.e., Create, Read, Update, Delete) support for tasks.</li>
          <li>Undo operations (at least for the most recent action)</li>
          <li>Some flexibility in the command format: Support a few natural variations
            of the command format.</li>
          <li>Simple search: A simple text search for finding an item if the user remembers
            some keywords from the item description.</li>
          <li>Some way to keep track of which items are done and which are yet to be
            done.</li>
          <li>The ability to specify a specific folder and a file for data storage.
            With this feature, Jim can choose to store the data file in a local folder
            controlled by a cloud syncing service (e.g. dropbox), allowing him to access
            task data from multiple computers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Nice to have features :</strong> (you may implement 0 or more of
          these features)</p>
        <p>Difficulty-low</p>
        <ul>
          <li>AutomatedTesting : Achieve a very high level of automated testing.</li>
          <li>RecurringTasks: Support for managing recurring tasks. e.g. CS2103 lectures
            are a recurring task from week 1 to week 13 except in recess week.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Difficulty-medium</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PowerSearch : More powerful and intelligent search. e.g. search for empty
            slots, near-match search, auto-complete (similar to Google search box),
            filters for other attributes (e.g. start time).</li>
          <li>FlexiCommands: High flexibility in command format. e.g., non-strict ordering
            of keywords, ability to specify aliases for commands, support for more
            ‘natural’ language input, multiple undo/redo, How flexible should the format
            be? As flexible, intuitive, and user-friendly as you can make it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Difficulty-high</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GoodGui: A good GUI to give visual feedback to the user e.g., in-built
            guidance for new users, good visual feedback for actions, feedback while
            typing commands, hotkey to activate/hide, notifications, etc. conveying
            more information visually (e.g. more important/urgent tasks stand out from
            the rest, longer events look different from shorter events, easy to see
            free slots, etc.)</li>
          <li>GoogleIntegration: Google Calendar integration. e.g. upload todo items
            to GCal, two-way sync, Support for GCal quick add command format, etc.
            You may also use the Google Tasks API for this.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also propose your own extra features(subject to approval). Note
          that
          <mark>each student must implement at least one feature individually (in addition
            to features implemented collectively with other team members) and the average
            amount of code one member is expected to write for the project is 0.5-1.5
            KLoC.</mark>Reason: Each student must learn all parts of the code and write
          a significant amount of code.</p>
        <p>Adding more features may not necessarily increase your score as
          <mark>half-baked features, ill-fitting features, and buggy features will bring
            your score down</mark>.</p>

    <h2 id="project-constraints">Project Constraints</h2>
    <div id="handbook-project-constraints">
      <div>
        <p>You should also comply with the following constraints. The purpose of
          these constraints is to increase comparability among submissions and to
          maximize applicability of module content in the project.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Constraint-Morph</strong>: The final product should be a result
              of morphing the given sample code. i.e. enhance and/or evolve the given
              code to arrive at the new software.
              <br>Reason: To ensure your code has a decent quality level from the start.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Constraint-Desktop</strong>: The software should be a desktop
              app (i.e. not a Mobile or a Web app). Reason: Desktop apps are more general
              than other platforms such as mobile/embedded/web and therefore, provides
              a good starting point before you move to those platforms.
              <br>You are allowed to integrate with online services such as Google Calendar
              as long as the app can provide a reasonable level of functionality even
              when offline.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Constraint-CLI</strong>: Command Line Interface is the primary
              mode of input. If you implement a GUI, it should be primarily for output.
              That is, the GUI is used to give visual feedback rather than to collect
              input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button),
              but the primary input should be command-driven. Mouse actions should have
              keyboard alternatives and typing is preferred over key combinations. Design
              the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse
              or key combinations.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Constraint-Standalone</strong>: The software should work stand-alone.
              It should not be a plug-in to another software. However, you can build
              optional extensions that integrate your application with other existing
              software. Furthermore, you are allowed to build extensions that can plug
              into your software.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Constraint-No-Database</strong>: The software should not use relational
              databases. Data storage must be done using text files you create yourself.
              <br>Reason: Using relational databases reduces the scope for applying Object-oriented
              techniques.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Constraint-Human-Editable-File</strong>: The data should be stored
              locally and should be in a human editable text file. The intention of this
              constraint is to allow advanced users to manipulate the data by editing
              the data file.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Constraint-OO</strong>: The software should follow the Object-oriented
              paradigm.
              <br>Reason: For you to practice OOP that you learned in the course.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Constraint-Windows</strong>: The software should work on the Windows
              7 or later.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Constraint-No-Installer</strong>: The software should work without
              requiring an installer. Having an optional installer is OK as longs as
              the portable (non-installed) version has all the critical functionality.
              <br>Reason: We do not want to install all your projects on our testing machines
              when we test them for grading.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Constraint-External-Software</strong>: The use of third-party
              frameworks/libraries is allowed but only if they,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>are free.</li>
              <li>do not require any installation by the user of your software.</li>
              <li>do not violate other constraints.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and subject to prior approval by us. We will not allow third-party software
              that can interfere with the learning objectives of the module. Please post
              your request for approval in IVLE forum before you start using the library.
              Reason: The whole class should know which external software are used by
              others so that they can do the same if they wish to.</p>

        <h3 id="step-1-brainstorm-user-stories">Step 1 : Brainstorm user stories</h3>
        <img src="images/v00.png" width="250px">
        <p>Get together with your team members and brainstorm user stories for the
          product.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>e.g.
            <br><code>As a user I can add a task by specifying a task description only, so that I can record tasks that need to be done ‘some day’.</code>
            <br><code>As a user I can find upcoming tasks, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.</code>
            <br><code>As a user I can delete a task, so that I can get rid of tasks that I no longer care to track.</code>
            <br><code>As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to use various commands.</code>
            <br><code>As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.</code>
            <br>Note how the story covers who (the user), what (the functionality) and
            why (the value) aspects.</li>
          <li>It is ok to have more user stories than you can deliver in the project.You
            should have at least 30 user stories. Include all 'obvious' ones you can
            think of but also look for 'non obvious' ones that you think are likely
            to be missed by other teams.</li>
          <li>Write each use story in a piece of paper (e.g. yellow sticky note, index
            card, or just pieces of paper about the size of a playing card). Alternatively
            you can use an online tool such as Trello for recording the initial collection
            of user stories.</li>
          <li>Note that
            <mark>you should not 'evaluate' the value of user stories while doing the above</mark>.
            An important aspect of brainstorming is not judging the ideas generated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="step-2-prioritize-the-user-stories">Step 2: Prioritize the user stories</h3>
        <img src="images/userstories.png" width="250px">
        <p>Suggested workflow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Take one use story at a time and get team member opinions about it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto
              one of these three piles:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>Must-Have</code> : The product will be practically useless to Jim
                without this feature.</li>
              <li><code>Nice-To-Have</code> : Jim can benefit from this user story significantly
                but you are not certain if you'll have time to implement it.</li>
              <li><code>Not-Useful</code> : No significant benefit to Jim.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>After all stories have been put in the above three piles, you can make
              a record of which stories are in the three piles.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some tips to improve the effectiveness of the above activity:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Define Jim:</strong>
            <br>Decide our target user Jim's work patterns. e.g. Does he work in groups
            or alone? Does he share his computer with others? (answer: no). Having
            a clear picture of Jim's work patterns will help when deciding the importance
            of a user story.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't be biased by the implementation plans:</strong>
            <br>This exercise is for identifying user needs. Clear your mind of ideas
            you have about what your product will look like. Assume that you do not
            know yet what product you will build.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong>
            <br>At this point, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough
            for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later.
            If a user story in the Nice-To-Have pile turn out to be too difficult to
            implement later, you can always not implement it.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong>
            <br>Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least
            for some potential users.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't go into too much details when sorting user stories:</strong>
            <br>For example, consider this user story:
            <ul>
              <li>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most
                at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.*
                <br>When discussing this user story, you do not need to worry about what tasks
                should be considered 'needs my attention most at the present time'. Those
                details can be worked out later.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="step-3-survey-existing-products">Step 3: Survey existing products</h3>
        <p>See how well existing products meet Jim's needs.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Select a few competing products to study. Each person should study at
              least one existing product. Identify strengths and weaknesses of the product
              w.r.t. how well it can cater for Jim’s requirements.</p>
            <p>Here are some popular 'task manager' type products out there you can consider
              exploring (you are not limited to these): Google Calendar + Google Tasks
              | <a href="https://hitask.com">HiTask</a> | <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a> |

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Don’t get discouraged if an existing product meets
              Jim’s needs quite well. We are trying to learn SE, not sell a product.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>After looking at existing products, you may want to go back and revise
              some of the user stories.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="step-4-conceptualize-the-product-as-a-user-guide">Step 4: Conceptualize the product as a user guide</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Based on your user story categorization in step 1 and given project requirements
            (note that the project requirements specify some must-have features), select
            which user stories you are likely to include in V0.5.</li>
          <li>Based on the user stories you selected above, specify the product you
            are going to build, in the form of a user guide. Yes, strangely enough,
            in this project we draft the user guide before we build the product. This
            will help you/us visualize the final product before you start implementing
            it.</li>
          <li>
            <mark>Remember to take into account the UI design and the functionalities available
              in AddressBook Level 4</mark>. As you will be using that software as the
            starting point of your implementation, it makes sense to align your product
            with it (within reason) to minimize the implementation effort.</li>
          <li>Remember to include the exact command format because it is the core part
            of your UI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use the documentation in the sample project as an example. Given below
          are pages to update.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>User guide</strong>:
              <br>Describe what the product would be like when it is submitted at the end
              of the semester. Starting from the time user starts using the product for
              the first time, describe how the user uses the product to accomplish various
              tasks.
              <br>Here are some ‘quick start guides’ you can look at for inspiration when
              writing your user guide:
              <br><a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate/blob/master/docs/User-Guide.md">Collate project</a>,
              <a

                <br>Use UI prototypes/sketches if necessary. They can be simple sketches drawn
                on whiteboard/paper and scanned/photographed or created using a tool such
                as PowerPoint, HTML, or <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balasmiq</a>.

          <li>
            <p><strong>Developer guide</strong>: Update the following appendices.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>User Stories</strong>: Give a list of the user stories, including
                priorities. This can include user stories considered but will not be included
                in the final product.</li>
              <li><strong>Use cases</strong>: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative
                user stories that need multiple steps to complete. e.g.
                <ul>
                  <li>Rescheduling a task, which may require two steps: locating the task first
                    and then updating it.</li>
                  <li>Checking a day's schedule at the end of the day: requires filtering the
                    day's tasks, marking complete tasks as done, and rescheduling or deleting
                    remaining tasks.</li>

              <li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong>:
                <br>Note: User stories capture functional requirements. What are the non-functional
                requirements of your project? Many of the project constraints mentioned
                above are NFRs. You can add more. e.g. performance requirements, usability
                requirements, scalability requirements, etc.</li>
              <li><strong>Glossary</strong>: Define terms that are worth defining.</li>
              <li><strong>Product survey</strong>: Describe a summary of the product survey.
                i.e. Pros, cons, (from Jim's point of view). Each student should document
                the product they explored. If multiple students have explored the same
                product, you may have to explore more products to complete this section.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Suggested length</strong>: Take the sample project as a baseline.</p>
        <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Update the relevant sections of the relevant
          markdown documents (i.e. <code>UserGuide.md, DeveloperGuide.md</code>) in
          your repo. <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">git tag</a> as <code>V0.0</code>.</p>
        <p><strong>Grading</strong>: Reaching this milestone (and future milestones)
          will be counted under 'Project management' component of the final project
          grade.
          <br>To claim this milestone as 'reached', you should at least have a full
          draft version of the above documents in some format (e.g. GoogleDoc), even
          if you didn't have time to update the markdown documents in the repo.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>example 1. Has a well-developed functionality to add tasks but does not

          <li>
            <p>example 2. Has all the CRUD functionality implemented but they are not

        <p><strong>Submission</strong>: Push the code to GitHub and <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">git tag</a> as <code>V0.2</code>.</p>

      <div>
        <h3 id="v03-product">V0.3 Product</h3>
        <p>This version should be a more functional version than V0.2 and should
          contain at least a basic version of features you intend to release in the
          final version.</p>
        <p>Ideally, V0.3 should be good enough for <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dogfooding%20(to%20dogfood)">dog fooding</a>.
          Try to reach a dogfooding-ready version of the 'must have' features at
          least.</p>
        <p>From V0.3,
          <mark>you are required to divide work based on features</mark>rather than component.
          That is, each team member should implement 0 or more features end-to-end,
          doing required changes in <em>all</em> components. The objective of this
          switch is to force you to learn all components of the software, instead
          of limiting yourself to your own components.
          <br>Note that you will continue to be in charge of your own components although
          others will be modifying your components' code. Your new role is to help
          others modify code in your components (you are supposed to be the most
          knowledgeable about those components) and protect your components from
          degrading. For example, you can review others' changes to your components
          and suggest possible changes. This is also a good time to switch to a PR
          based workflow (if you haven't done that already) as PRs can be reviewed
          by other team members before merging.</p>
        <p><strong>Submission</strong>: V0.3 (and future milestones)
          <mark>should be released using GitHub's release mechanism</mark>. The release
          should include an executable JAR file. Refer the <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1617S2/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#making-a-release">'Making a Release' section of the sample developer guide</a> for
          more info.</p>
        <p><strong>Grading</strong>: To pass this checkpoint, your product should
          be noticeably better than an MVP. It goes without saying that other project
          management requirements expected at reaching a milestone (mentioned in
          the <a href="#using-milestones">'Using Milestones' section of Appendix E</a>)
          are applicable too.</p>
        <h3 id="v03-documentation">V0.3 Documentation</h3>
        <p>Follow the documentation in the sample project in terms or organization,
          level of details, etc.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User Guide</strong>: Update User Guide to match what you plan
            to deliver at V0.5</li>
          <li><strong>Developer Guide</strong>: Update Developer Guide to match your
            current design or the design you plan to have at V0.5.
            <br>[1] While it is OK for some sections to be written collectively,
            <mark>each student should have some sections that were written individually</mark>.
            For example, the section describing the design of Logic component should
            be written by the person in charge of the Logic component.
            <br>[2] It is
            <mark>not enough to simply do minor tweaks to the existing document</mark>to
            match your project if your design is very similar to the sample given.
            We need to see a significant amount of content written by each student
            to judge how well you can document technical details and use relevant models.
            <br>Here are some things you can add:
            <ul>
              <li>Compare the current design with other alternative designs possible.</li>
              <li>Add more descriptions e.g. show at least one interaction within each component.</li>
              <li>Use object diagrams to show sample object structures at runtime (if it
                helps the reader).</li>

          (Dogfooding is an acceptance test; it should be done in the user environment)</p>
        <p><strong>Mark your code</strong> with special tag <code>@@author</code> so
          that we can extract code written by each of you using the collate tool
          (for evaluation purposes). After that, Use the collate tool to extract
          individual code and look through the generated <strong>.md</strong> files
          to ensure all your code has been extracted correctly.
          <mark>Push the *.md files created to a folder called /collated</mark>in your
          repo. More instructions below.</p>
        <p><strong>Extract your code for code quality grading</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author matric-number</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.
              The comment syntax may vary based on file type e.g. for markdown, fxml,
              html</p><pre><code>&lt;!-- @@author matric-number --&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>Here is a sample code file:</p><pre><code>//@@author A0909865T
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author A0702345U
method 3 ...
//@@author A0909865X
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the
              code a person wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code> tag
              or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was
              written by that author.
              <br>However, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no matric number)
              to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote, if you don't know who
              wrote the code segment below yours. The author of that code segment can
              add the matric number to the empty tag later.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If a method was written by more than one person, the <code>//@@author</code> tag
              should indicate the person who wrote most of that method. i.e., <code>//@@author</code> tag
              should not appear inside a method.
              <br>If some part of the code was done collectively, you should still divide
              it up to reflect the amount of work each person contributed. For example,
              if 3 people wrote 150 lines of code and put in equal effort in doing so,
              you can divide the methods among yourselves roughly 50 lines to each person.
              Once a code segment is allocated to one person, that person is responsible
              (and will be graded for) the quality of that code. If parts of that code
              was written by someone else and those parts are not of high quality, the
              designated author should refactor the code to make it high quality.
              <br>Tip: GitHub has a 'blame' feature and a 'history' feature that can help
              you determine who wrote a piece of code.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do not put the <code>//@@author</code> inside java header comments as only
              the content below that tag will be collated.</p><pre><code>/**
  * Returns true if ...
  * @@author A0909865T
  */
</code></pre><pre><code>//@@author A0909865T
/**
  * Returns true if ...
  */
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final
              product,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create a folder called <code>{project root}/unused</code>
              </li>
              <li>Move unused files to that folder (those files should contain unused code
                only)</li>
              <li>use <code>//@@author matric-number</code> to mark unused code in those files.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>e.g.</p><pre><code>//@@author A0909865T-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
</code></pre>
            <p>Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <code>//@@author</code> tag should be used to mark <em>all</em> code/test
              you claim credit for. There is no need to mark documentation files.
              <br>You will be penalized if you try to boost the length of your collated
              files using unethical means such as duplicating the same code in multiple
              places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant
              tests. Even repetitive code blocks within test methods should be extracted
              out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.
              <br>Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated
              files contain the correct content.
              <br>If you notice a team member claiming credit for code that he/she did not
              write, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>INCLUDE</strong>: everything that required significant ‘writing’
                  effort. e.g. comments, test code, styling (e.g. css), xml, even test data
                  files. But do not include chunks of text that were trivially copy pasted
                  e.g. a test data file with 1000 tasks that was used to test performance.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Duration: 10 minutes (max)</li>
            <li>It
              <mark>should be a 'well prepared' demo</mark>. You should know in advance exactly
              what you'll do in the demo.</li>
            <li>It should be a full demo: Cover all features you have, not just features
              you added recently.</li>
            <li>It is a 'sitting down' demo: As before, you'll be demonstrating the features
              using the TV while sitting down.</li>
            <li>Tutor will not interrupt you during the demo. That means you should finish
              within the given time.</li>
            <li>It should be done by 2 members (i.e. one person do the first half, the
              other do the 2nd half).
              <br>If you are not taking part in this demo, you must take part in V0.5 demo.
              <br>One or more persons can do the typing for the whole demo. Speaking should
              be done by the two designated to do the demo.</li>
            <li>The app should be populated with a significant amount of realistic data
              at the start. e.g data going back to at least two weeks and up to two weeks
              in future, about 50 items in total.</li>

        <p>Functionality expectations: <strong>Freeze features</strong> after reaching

              <li><strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level
                manager of your company, to brief him/her on the current capabilities of
                the product.
                <br>The scenarios you demonstrate should be chosen judiciously so that you
                cover the full range of your product's functionality. Give more time to
                stronger features (i.e. cover mundane/basic features fast). It is recommended
                you showcase how the product improves the user’s workflow rather than simply
                describe each feature.
                <br>No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested
                in those details.</li>
              <li><strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but
                it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.</li>
              <li><strong>Testing:</strong> All team member should remain in the holding
                area during the tutorial slot (when you are not doing the demo) because
                our testers might need to communicate with you during the testing.
                <br>Holding area for Active Learning Room: Unused area of the room (enter
                by the door near the staircase)
                <br>Holding area for SR5: Tables outside SR5</li>
              <li><strong>Structure:</strong>
                <br>Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own
                laptop, using the TV.
                <br>Every team member should take part in the demo. However, it's ok for one
                member to do all the typing.</li>
              <li><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong>
                <br>Try to make the maximum use of the short demo time in the following ways,
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product. Not
                      recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or
                      lengthy narrations.
                      <br>Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch
                      or an informercial. While you need to show how a user use the product to
                      get value, but you don’t need to act like an imaginary user. For example,
                      [Instead of this]<code>Jim get’s a call from boss. &quot;Ring ring&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;oh hi Jim, can we postpone the meeting?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.</code>
                      <br>[do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code>
                      <br>It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t
                      have enough time for it.
                      <br>Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context → Different
                      requirements.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo.
                      <mark>Demos that are clearly under-prepared will be penalized.</mark>

                      the target audience knows that the product is a task manager targeting
                      Jim-like users. That means no need to explain those things again.
                      <br>Also assume the target audience knows who you are. That means no need
                      to say things like &quot;We are students from NUS, SoC&quot;.</p>

                    <p>Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the
                      system. You should not plan to type all the sample data during the demo
                      itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just a couple
                      of sample tasks creates a bad impression too.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For
                      example, if you are trying to convince that the product is easy to use,
                      show the easiest way to enter a task before you show the full command with
                      all the bells and whistles.</p>

        <p>The project Retrospective answers the following question:
          <mark>If you were to redo this project from the beginning, what would you do
            differently and why?</mark>

          <li>State at least three things you would do differently.</li>
          <li>Justify your answers using concrete details. What didn’t work this time?
            How do you plan to avoid the problem next time? Why do you think the modification
            will give you a better outcome.</li>

        <p>The report should contain an itemized list of your contribution to the
          project. Be as concrete and precise as possible. For example, you can mention
          how many lines of code you wrote in which classes, which parts of the documentation

        <p>Note that project grading is
          <mark>not competitive (not bell curved)</mark>.
          <mark>CS2103T projects will be assessed separately from CS2103 projects.</mark>This
          is to account for the perceived difference in workload. Given below is
          the marking scheme.</p>
        <p><strong>Total</strong>: 50 marks (25 individual marks + 25 team marks)</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Product features</strong> [team][10 marks] - How good is your software
              as a product?</p>
            <p>Based on the features implemented, how well they fit together to make
              a good product, and how well they are demonstrated.</p>
            <p>‘Half-baked’ (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does
              not go well with the other features) features will not earn marks at all
              and could even be penalized. It may be better to remove such features before
              submission.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Design</strong> [individual][5 marks] - How good is your internal
              design?</p>
            <p>Evaluated
              <mark>solely based on what we can learn from the developer guide.</mark>Evaluated
              by lecturer. You will be graded individually on the design of your component
              and how well you have described it. Collective design decisions such as
              architecture will affect the grade of all team members.</p>
            <p>Criteria considered:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Conformance with the multi-level top-down approach (i.e. design at high-level
                first, and do the lower-level design of each component later)</li>
              <li>Conformance with the OO paradigm</li>
              <li>Application of patterns and principles</li>
              <li>Quality of documentation e.g. using the right diagram at the right place.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Implementation</strong> [individual][15 marks] - How good is your
              implementation? A measure of the
              <mark>quality and the quantity</mark>of code you have written yourself. On average,
              a student is expected to write 0.5-1.5 KLoC. Evaluated based on an inspection
              of the collated code (submitted in your *.md files) by at least two tutors.
              <br>Criteria considered:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Following SLAP (IMPORTANT).</li>
              <li>Following the coding standard given (IMPORTANT).</li>
              <li>Using at least some assertions.</li>
              <li>Using at least some logging.</li>
              <li>Using at least some unit tests.</li>
              <li>Commenting at the right level.</li>
              <li>Exception handling.</li>
              <li>Neatness and human readability.Expectations:</li>
              <li>Each person is expected to implement one or more features individually
                in addition to features implemented collectively. Each person is expected
                to write backend code, frontend code, test code, user documentation, and
                developer documentation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>QA</strong> [team: 5 marks], [individual: 5 marks] - How good is
              your Quality Assurance? Evaluated based on our own testing. A well written
              user guide and a product that conforms to the user guide (i.e. no bugs)
              will give you a high mark.</p>
            <p>Things considered for team grade: Bugs including validation issues (i.e.
              not meeting project requirements)</p>
            <p>Things considered for individual grade: Quality and quantity of the test
              code in your collated code.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Expectations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no requirement for a minimum coverage level. Note that in a production
            environment you are often required to have at least 90% of the code covered
            by tests. In this project, it can be less.</li>
          <li>How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide.
            You learned different types of testing and what they try to achieve. Based
            on that, you should decide how much of each type is required. Similarly,
            you can decide to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on
            the benefits and the effort required.</li>
          <li>Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better
            to apply TDD because TDD ensures that you write functional code in a testable
            way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test
            the functional code because the code has low testability.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="7">
          <li><strong>Documentation</strong> [team][5 marks] - How well does your user
            guide achieves its objectives? Evaluated by lecturer and TA.
            <br>Criteria considered:
            <ul>
              <li>Explanation should be clear and written to match the audience.</li>
              <li>Good use of visuals to complement text.Note: Developer Guide is graded
                under the 'Design' component.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Project management</strong> [team: 5 marks][individual: 5 marks]
            - How well you worked together as a team to follow a systematic process?
            <br>For the team component, we look for,
            <ul>
              <li>Good version control, based on the repo.</li>
              <li>Good task definition, assignment and tracking, based on the issue tracker.</li>
              <li>Good use of buffers (opposite: everything at the last minute)</li>
              <li>Iterative (opposite: fake iterative, doing most of the work in one iteration).
                <br>Passed almost all checkpoints from V0.0 to V0.5The individual component
                is determined by peer evaluation from your project team members.</li>

              team that include both Chinese and Malay students.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>No more than one exchange students per team (rationale: to increase interaction

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>All team members should be in the same tutorial.

It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. <mark>Those who give ineffective feedback will be penalized.</mark></p><p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.</li><li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>) to the same team member is not being honest.</li><li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.</li></ul></span>
          <p>The final peer evaluation will be used to determine the level of contribution
            from each member to the project. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked

            to the project so far.</p>
          <img src="images/peer evaluations.png" width="70%">
          <p>
            <mark>Final peer evaluation affects your grade</mark>in the following way:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If there is a general consensus about how much each one contributed, we
              award grades based on the contribution levels submitted through the peer
              evaluation. i.e., if everyone agrees you did more than others, you get
              more marks.</li>
            <li>If there are significant discrepancies in the peer evaluations (e.g.,
              you say you did an [equal share + 20%] while your team says you did an
              [equal share - 10%]), we will investigate further before finalizing project
              marks. For such teams, we are likely to request some or all members to
              <mark>submit an additional individual report</mark>to itemize and quantify the
              contribution to the project.
              <mark>Overclaimers will be penalized.</mark>Please do not claim high just to
              ‘see how’.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Peer evaluations are
            <mark>not visible to undergraduate tutors.</mark>
          </p>
          <p>
            <mark>If you disagree with the team’s opinion</mark>, i.e., you think the perceived
            contribution is significantly different from what you actually contributed,
            you can help us grade you fairly by submitting an individual report (‘individual
            report’ is explained under V0.5 deliverables).</p>
          <p>Keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are based
            on team member perceptions and may not reflect your real contribution.
            <mark>We use those numbers primarily to identify cases that need further investigation.</mark>
          </p>
          <p>You may
            <mark>ignore minor variations</mark>in the contribution numbers reported by
            TEAMMATES. For example, the difference between [Equal share] and [Equal
            share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due to rounding off
            within the system.</p>
          <p>Also keep in mind that it is human nature for one to downplay the value
            of contributions from others when one’s own contribution is being compared
            to that of others. As a result, it is common for the ‘perceived contribution’
            to be somewhat lower than what you actually did.</p>
          <p>If you are unhappy about the peer-feedback received and would like to
            make your views known to the team, please allow at least one day to lapse
            before you fire off a response email. You are likely to respond more rationally
            when you had some time to think it over. Also keep in mind that we do take
            note of how well you handle such a situation. You need to act professionally
            when facing conflicting views, opposition, and even deliberate sabotage.</p>

                  <p>
                    <mark>Please be sincere about how much you can do from the beginning</mark>,
                    rather than let your team members figure it out over the long run. Tell
                    them how much you can do and what kind of work you are willing to do. If
                    you are not open about it, they will still figure it out at the end; they
                    will still report it (via the peer-evaluations), and your score will be
                    adjusted all the same. Being open about it on the other hand can save everyone
                    a lot of frustrations, unpleasantness, and bitterness.</p>

        <p><strong>Communication</strong>:</p>
        <p>Keeping a record of communications among your team can help you, and us,
          in many ways. We encourage you to do at least some of the project communication
          in written medium (e.g., GitHub Issue Tracker) to practice how to communicate
          technical things in written form.</p>
        <p><strong>Collaboration platform</strong>: We are going to
          <mark>use GitHub as the hosting and collaboration platform</mark>of your project
          (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.). See <a href="#handbook-appendixE-github">Appendix E</a> for
          more info on how to setup and use GitHub for your project.</p>
        <p><strong>IDE</strong>: We
          <mark>require you to use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a>
          </mark>(latest stable release) for module related programming work. Because all
          team members will work on the same code base and project tutors too have
          to go through the code for testing and evaluation, it is troublesome to
          use multiple IDEs. Furthermore, when everyone uses the same tool, it creates
          a bigger collective know-how about the tool which makes troubleshooting
          easier and the productivity higher.</p>
        <p><strong>Revision control</strong>:</p>
        <p>You are required to use Git. Other revision control software are not allowed.
          <br>The recommended GUI client for Git is <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> (which
          comes bundled with Git), but you may use any other, or none.</p>

          <li>2 hours, open book, essay type questions (no MCQ), covers materials from
            all lectures, handouts, and tutorials.</li>
          <li>Sample exam papers that are closest to this semester's format (and examiner's
            comments) can be found <a href="../files/exampapers/">here</a>.</li>
          <li>Attend the last two lecture to learn more about the exam paper.</li>
          <li>Exam consultations (consultations near the exam) are discouraged but allowed.
            We prefer you to learn and clarify along the way, not at the end.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Go through the worked examples in handouts.</li>
              <li>Try past exam papers. Try to answer the questions before looking at answers
                given.</li>
              <li>Learn all parts of the project, not just the part you did.</li>

        <p>Note that CS2103 paper measures how well you can apply the theory to a
          project. Therefore, the exam is strongly connected to the project and how
          you  applied theory in the project. The exam will be easy for you if you
          attend lectures, participate in tutorials(tutorials too are focused on
          application of theory to the project), and do a sincere job in the project.
          <mark>You will not be able to ace the exams by simply doing past papers just
            before the exams.</mark>

        <p><strong>[ You . Together . Continuously . Reach ]</strong>
        </p>
        <p>These are some of the main principles underlying the module structure.</p>
        <p>The product is you, NOT what you build.</p>
        <p>The software product you build is a side effect only. You are the product
          of this module. This means,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We may not take the most efficient route to building the software product.
            We take the route that allows you to learn the most.</li>
          <li>Building a software product that is unique, creative, and shiny is not
            our priority (although we try to do a bit of that too). Learning to take
            pride in, and discovering the joy of, high quality software engineering
            work is our priority.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following from that, we evaluate you on not just how much you've done,
          but also, how well you've done those things.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the aspects in which we try to make you more professional:</p>

          expandable="">
            <p>Not responding to a personal email is a major breach of professional etiquette
              (and general civility). Imagine how pissed off you would be if you met
              me along the corridor, said 'Hi Damith, good morning' and I walked away
              without saying anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just
              as bad. Always take a few seconds to at least acknowledge such emails.
               It doesn't take long to type &quot;Noted. Thanks&quot; and hit 'send'.</p>
            <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting
              you for something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to me requesting
              a reference letter and I did not respond at all because I didn't want to
              give you one; You'll be quite frustrated because you wouldn't know whether
              to look for another professor or wait longer for my response. Saying 'No'
              is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying nothing
              is not acceptable. If you didn't reply, the sender will not even know whether
              you received the email.</p>

            <br>Is publishing submissions unfair to the team? We don't think so. If you

            that means you are already ahead of them and they are unlikely to earn
            more marks by adopting your ideas.</p>

        <div id="policy-plagiarism">
          <p>What's allowed:</p>
          <p>We encourage sharing, but you should share with everyone in the class,
            not just a selected group. That is,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You are not allowed to share individual assignments with classmates directly.</li>
            <li>You are not allowed to share project-related things with other teams directly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, note that most submissions will be published to the class after
            the submission deadline, after which they 
            <mark>can be 'reused' by others</mark> subject to the 'reuse policy' given below.</p>
          <p>If you submit code taken from elsewhere, you need to comply with our reuse
            policy.</p>
          <p>Detection:</p>
          <p>Detecting plagiarism in code is quite easy. You are not fooling anyone
            by reordering code or renaming methods/variables. Besides, all your submissions
            are published to the class and sooner or later somebody will notice the
            plagiarism.</p>
          <p>Penalties:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For activities earning participation marks: We make a record of cases
              of plagiarism but we do not take further action. Because participation
              marks are given for effort and all students can earn the full marks easily,
              such plagiarism does not disadvantage other students. Therefore, we prefer
              to spend all available resources on helping honest students to do better
              rather than to chase after dishonest students. If you think you gain something
              by plagiarizing, go ahead and do it. It's your choice and it's your loss.</li>
            <li>For the final project/exam: Any case of claiming others' work as yours
              will be reported to the university for disciplinary action.</li>

                  <mark>do not use 3rd-party images/audio</mark> in your software unless they
                  have been specifically released to be used freely. Just because you found

          <p>CS2103/T prepares you for many higher-level project modules (CS3216/7,
            CS3201/2, CS3281/2/3/4, CG3002, etc.), each requiring a slightly different
            skill set. It is also the only SE course some of you do before going for
            industry internships. Therefore, we have to cover many essential SE concepts/skills
            and also provide enough exercises for you to practice those skills. This
            is also why we don't have time to go very deep into any of the topics.</p>
          <p>Remember, everything you learn here is going to be useful in a SE-related
            career.</p>
          <p>Also, consider this a gradual introduction to 'heavy' modules; most project

            for a high-end SE career, CS2103 tutorships, recommendation letters from
            the module lecturer, to enroll in selective modules (e.g. CS3216/7), etc.</p>

          <img src="images/small things matter.png" width="600" height="300">
          <p>Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being
            equal, a job may be offered to the candidate who has the neater looking
            CV although both have the same qualifications. This may be unfair, but
            that's how the world works. Students forget this harsh reality when they
            are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with
            their work habits. That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small
            ones (e.g., following precise submission instructions, arriving on time
            etc.).</p>
          <p>But unlike the real world, we are forgiving. That is why you can still

          <p>On a related note, keep in mind that 'hunting and gathering' of relevant

          <p>Handouts are wordy because they are reference materials for you to study

          <p>Self-study is a critical survival skill in SE industry. Lectures will
            show you the way, but absorbing content is to be done at your own pace,
            by yourself. In this module, we still tell you what content to study and
            also pass most of the content to you. After you graduate, you have to decide

            your home PC remotely), <em>without</em> requiring extra time/effort from

          <p>Defining your own unique project is more fun.</p>
          <p>But, wider scope → more diverse projects → harder for us to go deep into
            your project. The collective know-how we (i.e., students and the teaching
            team) build up about SE issues related to the project become shallow and
            stretched too thinly. It also affects fairness of grading.</p>
          <img src="images/limited project scope.png"
          width="772" height="296">
          <p>That is why a strictly-defined project is more suitable for a first course
            in SE that focuses on nuts-and-bolts of SE. After learning those fundamentals,
            in higher level project modules you can focus more on the creative side
            of software projects without being dragged down by nuts-and-bolts SE issues
            (because you already know how to deal with them). However, we would like
            to allow some room for creativity too. That is why we let you build products
            that are slight variations of a given theme.</p>
          <p>Also note: The freedom to do 'anything' is not a necessary condition for
            creativity. Do not mistake being different for being creative. In fact,
            the more constrained you are, the more you need creativity to stand out.</p>

          <p>&quot;You tell me exactly what to do - I do that - you pay me (in grades)&quot;
            is a model for contract work, not for learning. Being able to survive in
            imprecise, uncertain, volatile problem contexts is precisely what we are
            trying to teach you.</p>
          <p>For example, the best way to communicate something often depends on what
            is being communicated. That is why we don't specify the precise content
            for project documents. Instead, we aim to refine project documents iteratively.
            We believe the learning experience will be richer if we let you decide
            the best way to present your project information rather than just following
            our instructions blindly. For example, in real-life projects you are rarely
            told which diagrams to draw; that is a decision you have to make yourself.</p>

          <img src="images/I'm not allowed to use my favorite tool.png" width="750"
          height="287">
          <p>We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning,
            availability, typicalness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc.
            There are many reasons for limiting your choices:</p>
          <p>Pedagogical reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We use 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools: Most bleeding edge,
              most specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner
              course. After mastering our toolset, you will find it easy to upgrade to
              such high-end tools by yourself. We do expect you to eventually (after
              this module) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one
              tool, to attain a more general understanding about a family of tools.</li>
            <li>Learn to thrive under given conditions: As a professional Software Engineer,
              you must learn to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than
              insist on using your preferred tools. It is usually in small companies
              doing less important work that you get to chose your own toolset. Bigger
              companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers,
              such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language etc.
              For example, Google uses SVN as their revision control software. Sometimes
              this is due to cost reasons (tool licensing cost), and sometimes due to
              legacy reasons (because the tool is already entrenched in their code base).
              <br>While programming in school is often a solo sport, programming in the
              industry is a team sport. As we are training you to become professional
              software engineers, it is important to get over the psychological hurdle
              of needing to satisfy individual preferences and get used to making the
              best of a given environment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Practical reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some of the learning activities are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing
              more tools means tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their
              workload.</li>
            <li>We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Getting started with Eclipse'.
              Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.</li>
            <li>When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool
              is more, increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other
            tools.</p>

          <p>The high number of submissions is not meant to increase workload but to

            be done in parallel to maximize the learning effect. That can happen only

        <p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies
          to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference
          between <em>aaa</em> and <em>bbb</em>?</p>
        <p>What not to do: Email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a
          problem or a doubt, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed
          to know.</p>
        <p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, here are
          the things you should do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has
              been discussed in the lectures, handouts, or the list of resources given
              to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer
              instead, but that shouldn't be your default behavior. We know that sometimes
              it is difficult to find stuff in handouts/handbook etc. But you should
              try first.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere
              in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered
              in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't
              give an opportunity for someone to tell you, 'Have you heard of a thing
              called Google?'.
              <br>Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains
              hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a 
              <mark>web search on the error message</mark>  is a good starting point.

                        to refer to a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story
                        in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry
                        around a rubber duck and debug his code by forcing himself to explain it,
                        line-by-line, to the duck.</p>

                  public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to
                  do your research' person in a public forum.</p>

                <p>Learn to isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going
                  to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time
                  to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and
                  strip it down to the bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes,
                  this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If
                  not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help
                  you.

Tip: How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.

                <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using
                  Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely
                  to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write
                  to a file using Java&quot;.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything
                  that is relevant to your problem, you chances of getting an answer in the
                  first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they
                  can help you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much
                  information into the thread either.

          <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases,
            and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy
            project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly
            to reflect the current status of the project. You can also use GitHub's
            new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to
            manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as

          <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the
              issue tracker.
              <br>e.g. <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code>
              <br><code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code>

            <li>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those
              issues.</li>
            <li>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks. Define reasonable
              sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in
              a few hours. e.g. 
              <br>Good: Update class diagram in the project manual for V0.5
              <br>Bad (reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough): Write the project
              manual</li>
            <li>Write a descriptive title for the issue. 
              <br>e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</li>
            <li>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks. Keep them as big
              as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign
              a single person to do within a week. So the user story <code>Implementing parser</code> 
              is too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week. However,<code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code> is
              of appropriate size.</li>
            <li>Do not track things taken for granted. e.g., 'push code to repo' should
              not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point,
              it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and
              (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as
              separate tasks.</li>
            <li>Omit unnecessary details. In some cases, the summary/title is enough to
              describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description.
              There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks.
              A minimal description is enough.
              <br>Similarly, labels such as 'priority' can be omitted if you think they
              don't help you.</li>
            <li>Assign tasks to team members using the 'owner' field. At any point, there
              should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</li>
            <li>Use status labels to indicate which tasks are completed, which are ongoing,
              and which are to be done by next milestone.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="using-milestones">Using Milestones:</h3><a name="using-milestones"></a>
          <ul>
            <li>Use milestones to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone
              by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</li>
            <li>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones
              can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</li>
            <li>Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT: To consider the milestone as 'reached',
              <mark>you should have the following done <em>before</em> the tutorial begins.
                'Missed milestones' will count against the 'project management' component
                of your final grade</mark>:
              <ul>
                <li>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. V0.2) and pushed to
                  the main repo.</li>
                <li>All tests passing on Travis.</li>
                <li>Milestone updated to match the product.</li>
                <li>Milestone closed. All issues assigned to that milestone should be closed
                  too.</li>
                <li>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for V0.1 and V0.2 but compulsory
                  from V0.3.</li>

          <h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
          <p>You may use any of the workflows described <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/">here</a> and
            their variations. You can start with a simpler workflow first and move
            to more complex ones as necessary.</p>
          <p>Here are some examples (ordered in increasing complexity):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Members push to the <code>master</code> branch (i.e. centralized workflow).</li>
            <li>Members push to feature branches of team repo and merge when ready (i.e.
              feature branch workflow without PRs).</li>
            <li>Members push to feature branches of team repo and create PRs in team repo
              (i.e. feature branch workflow with PRs).</li>
            <li>Members fork the team repo to their own account, push code to their own
              fork, and then create PRs from their fork to team repo using either the
              centralized or the feature branch workflow.</li>

    <h1 id="appendix-f-what-to-do-if-there-are-teamwork-issues">Appendix F: What to do if there are teamwork issues</h1>
    <div id="handbook-appendixF-teamworkIssues">
      <div>
        <p>If your team is facing difficulties due to differences in skill/motivation
          /availability among team members,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First,
            <mark>do not expect everyone to have the same skill/motivation level as you</mark>.
            It is fine if someone wants to do less and have low expectations from the
            module. That doesn't mean that person is a bad person. Everyone is entitled
            to have their own priorities.</li>
          <li>Second,
            <mark>don't give up</mark>. It is unfortunate that your team ended up in this
            situation, but you can turn it into a good learning opportunity. You don't
            get an opportunity to save a sinking team every day 😃</li>
          <li>Third, if you care about your grade and willing to work for it, you need
            to take initiative to turn the situation around or else the whole team
            is going to suffer. Don't hesitate to
            <mark>take charge</mark>if the situation calls for it. By doing so, you'll be
            doing a favor for your team. Be professional, kind, and courteous to the
            team members, but also be firm and assertive. It is your grade that is
            at stake. Don't worry about making a bad situation worse. You won't know
            until you try.</li>
          <li>Finally, don't feed angry or 'wronged'. Teamwork problems are not uncommon
            in this module and we know how to grade so that you will not be penalized
            for others' low contribution. We can use Git to find exactly what others
            did. It's not your responsibility to get others to contribute.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given below are some suggestions you can adopt if the project work is
          not going smooth due to team issues. Note that the below measures can result
          in some team members doing more work than others and earning better project
          grades than others. It is still better than sinking the whole team together.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Redistribute the work</strong>: Stronger programmers in the team
            should take over the critical parts of the code.</li>
          <li><strong>Enforce stricter integration workflow</strong>: Appoint an integrator
            (typically, the strongest programmer). His/her job is to maintain the integrated
            version of the code. He/she should not accept any code that breaks the
            existing product or is not up to the acceptable quality standard. It is
            up to others to submit acceptable code to the integrator. Note that if
            the integrator rejected your code unreasonably, you can still earn marks
            for that code. You are allowed to submit such 'rejected' code for grading.
            They can earn marks based on the quality of the code. Also refer the workflow
            described in the 'A safer workflow using forks and pull requests' section
            of the Handbook: Appendix E (Using GitHub Project Hosting)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>If you have very unreliable or totally disengaged team members</strong> :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Re-distribute project work so that such team members cannot bring down
            the entire team.</li>
          <li>However, do not leave out such team members from project communications.
            Always keep them in the loop so that they can contribute more any time
            they wish to.</li>
          <li>Furthermore, evaluate them sincerely and fairly during peer evaluations
            so that they do get the grade their work deserves, no more, no less.</li>
          <li>Be courteous to such team members too. Some folks have genuine problems
            that prevent them from contributing more although they may not be able
            tell you the reasons. Just do your best for the project and assume everyone
            else is doing their best too, although their best may be lower than yours.</li>
