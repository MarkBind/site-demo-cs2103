### V0.1 Product

This is the sample project morphed to be more like your target product. Functionality can be limited to only those that can be refactored from the sample project. e.g. support for adding and deleting floating tasks.

**Submission**: Push the code to GitHub and [git tag](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) as `V0.1`. Refer to the Schedule page for further submission instructions.

**Grading**: To consider this milestone as reached, you should have at least add/delete/find support for floating tasks. You should be able to do that by deleting/renaming the given Address Book code, without having to add too much new code.  
The most important thing is not to break the code while morphing sample code to your target product.

### V0.1 Documentation

Update the following pages:  

*   **About Us page**:  
    This page is used for module admin purposes. ==Please follow the format closely to avoid penalties==. For example, use a recent solo photo with your face clearly visible (similar to those in the 'Teaching Team' page).  
    The ==photo of a team member should be `doc/images/githbubid.png`== e.g. `doc/images/damithc.png` where `githubid` is the team member's GitHub ID **in lower case**. Remove photos of the SE-EDU developers. No need to include a photo of the supervisor.  

    Indicate the different roles played and responsibilities held by each team member. You can reassign these roles and responsibilities later in the project, if necessary.  

    <Panel header="**Roles and responsibilities**" expandable>
    Roles imply aspects you are in charge of and responsible for. E.g., if you are in charge of documentation, you are the person who should allocate who should write which part, ensure the document is in right format, ensure consistency etc.  
    Here are some typical roles:

    *   _Team lead_: Responsible for overall project coordination.
    *   _Documentation_ (short for ‘in charge of documentation’): Responsible for the quality of various project documents.
    *   _Testing_: Ensures the testing of the project is done properly and on time.
    *   _Code quality_: Looks after code quality, ensures adherence to coding standards, etc.
    *   _Deliverables and deadlines_: Ensure project deliverables are done on time and in the right format.
    *   _Integration_: In charge of versioning of the code, maintaining the code repository, integrating various parts of the software to create a whole.
    *   _Scheduling and tracking_: In charge of defining, assigning, and tracking project tasks.
    *   _[Tool ABC] expert_: e.g. Eclipse expert, Git expert, etc. Helps other team member with matters related to the specific tool.
    *   _In charge of[Component XYZ]_: e.g. In charge of Model, GUI, Storage, etc. If you are in charge of a component, you are expected to know that component well, do the initial refactoring of the component (during V0.1 and V0.2) and review changes done to that component in V0.3-V0.5.
    *   You may define additional roles.

    Please make sure each of the above roles are assigned to one person in the team. It is OK to have a ‘backup’ for each role, but you should still have one person who is unequivocally the main person playing that role.
    
    </Panel>

*   **README.md** page: Update it to match your project. In particular, add a UI mockup of your intended final product.  
    Note that the ==image of the UI should be `doc/images/Ui.png`== so that it can be downloaded by our scripts.  
    Also, remember to acknowledge the original source of the code i.e. The sample project created by SE-EDU initiative at `https://github.com/se-edu/`

**Grading**: To consider this milestone as reached, you should have all V0.0 deliverables completed and the two documents mentioned above updated.
